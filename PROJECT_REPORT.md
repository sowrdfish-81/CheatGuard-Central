# PART A — MEMBER 1: Core & Security (15 files)

## A1. What I say (opening, about 3 minutes)

"Good morning Sir. Our project is **Cheat.Guard** — a Windows desktop
application, written in Java, that locks a student's computer during an online
exam and keeps a written record of everything suspicious.

The problem is simple. In an online exam a student can open ChatGPT in another
tab, chat with a friend on Discord, plug in a USB stick, or use a VPN to open
blocked websites. Our program closes all these doors, and after the exam it
gives the teacher a sealed report as proof.

The flow is like this. The invigilator installs one setup file. On first launch
the program asks for an administrator password — there is no default password.
Then the invigilator sets which apps and websites are allowed. When the session
starts, the program first closes every app the student left running, then it
starts blocking. When the session ends, the program restores the computer and
seals the log with encryption.

My part is the core and security side: the session data, the password system,
and the sealing of the log. After me, my teammate will explain how the blocking
actually works."

## A2. How a session runs, step by step

1. **Install once.** One file, `CheatGuard-Setup.exe`, installs the program and
   its own copy of Java.
2. **First launch.** The invigilator picks an administrator password. Only an
   unreadable hash is stored, bound to that computer.
3. **Choose what is allowed.** The program already ships with the tools a
   programming contest needs (VS Code, gcc/g++, Java, Python, and sites like
   codeforces.com, atcoder.jp, leetcode.com). The invigilator can add or remove.
4. **Start the session.** The program asks for Windows admin permission once.
   It empties the clipboard (and the Win+V history), closes EVERY app the
   student left running, points every network card at its own DNS filter, and
   only then starts counting alerts.
5. **During the exam.** A running clock, a live event list in three colours,
   and two counters: red ALERTS (something got through) and yellow BLOCKED
   (they tried, the block held).
6. **End the session.** With the password: the computer is restored and the log
   is sealed with encryption and a signature.

## A3. My 14 files — full code + explanation

### 1) core/Violation.java — one suspicious event

```java
package com.cheatguard.core;

import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;

/**
 * OOP Concept: ENCAPSULATION
 * ---------------------------
 * Ei class ekta single "violation" (cheating attempt) ke represent kore.
 * Shob field 'private' -> bairer kono class direct field change korte parbe na,
 * shudhu getter দিয়ে read korte parbe. Eita data safety'r jonno important,
 * jate log tamper na hoy accidentally kono onno class theke.
 */
public class Violation {

    /**
     * INFO: tidy-up events that are not misconduct. NOTICE: the student tried
     * something that was blocked (a denied website lookup) — shown in yellow,
     * because the enforcement worked and nothing got through. WARNING/CRITICAL:
     * genuine red flags that count on the alert counter.
     */
    public enum Severity { INFO, NOTICE, WARNING, CRITICAL }

    private final LocalDateTime timestamp;
    private final String type;        // e.g. "ILLEGAL_PROCESS", "USB_INSERTED", "PROHIBITED_SITE"
    private final String description; // human readable detail
    private final Severity severity;

    public Violation(String type, String description, Severity severity) {
        this.timestamp = LocalDateTime.now();
        this.type = type;
        this.description = description;
        this.severity = severity;
    }

    public LocalDateTime getTimestamp() { return timestamp; }
    public String getType() { return type; }
    public String getDescription() { return description; }
    public Severity getSeverity() { return severity; }

    public boolean isRedFlag() {
        return severity == Severity.CRITICAL || severity == Severity.WARNING;
    }

    /**
     * Log e likhar jonno ekta single-line format.
     * CRITICAL/WARNING violation ke [RED-FLAG] tag diye mark kora hoy,
     * jate GUI dashboard eta dekhe red color e highlight korte pare.
     *
     * Line breaks in the description are flattened first: descriptions can carry
     * data from outside (process names, hosts) and a raw newline would let a crafted
     * name forge extra log lines that the dashboard would parse as real events.
     */
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        String tag = severity == Severity.NOTICE ? "[NOTICE]"
                : isRedFlag() ? "[RED-FLAG]" : "[NORMAL]";
        String ts = timestamp.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"));
        String safeDescription = description == null ? "" : description.replaceAll("[\\r\\n\\t]+", " ");
        String safeType = type == null ? "EVENT" : type.replaceAll("[\\r\\n\\t]+", " ");
        return String.format("%s %s %s :: %s - %s", ts, tag, severity, safeType, safeDescription);
    }
}
```

**What to notice:**
- The `Severity` enum has four levels. `isRedFlag()` is true only for
  WARNING/CRITICAL — NOTICE is the yellow "tried but blocked" level.
- All fields are `final`, no setters — **encapsulation + immutability**: a log
  entry can never be rewritten in memory.
- In `toString()`, `replaceAll("[\\r\\n\\t]+", " ")` flattens line breaks —
  that is the log-forgery defense: a program named with fake newlines cannot
  add its own log lines.

### 2) core/LogManager.java — the writer

```java
package com.cheatguard.core;

import java.io.*;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

/** Thread-safe append-only session logger with short retry for transient Windows file contention. */
public class LogManager {
    private final File logFile;
    private final List<Violation> violations = new ArrayList<>();

    public LogManager(File logFile) {
        this.logFile = logFile;
        try {
            File parent = logFile.getParentFile();
            if (parent != null) parent.mkdirs();
            if (!logFile.exists()) logFile.createNewFile();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            AppLog.warn("Could not create log file: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public synchronized void record(Violation v) {
        violations.add(v);
        String line = v.toString() + System.lineSeparator();
        IOException last = null;

        // Synchronized prevents competing watchdog/UI threads in this process.
        // A few short retries also tolerate brief Windows AV/indexer contention.
        for (int attempt = 0; attempt < 4; attempt++) {
            try {
                Files.write(logFile.toPath(), line.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8),
                        StandardOpenOption.CREATE, StandardOpenOption.WRITE, StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
                return;
            } catch (IOException e) {
                last = e;
                try { Thread.sleep(25L * (attempt + 1)); }
                catch (InterruptedException ie) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        AppLog.warn("Could not write log: " + (last == null ? "unknown error" : last.getMessage()));
    }

    public synchronized List<Violation> getAllViolations() { return new ArrayList<>(violations); }
    public File getLogFile() { return logFile; }
    public synchronized long getRedFlagCount() {
        long count = 0;
        for (Violation v : violations) if (v.isRedFlag()) count++;
        return count;
    }
}
```

**What to notice:**
- `record()` is `synchronized` — watchdog, DNS and UI threads all write at the
  same moment, so only one may enter at a time.
- The 4-attempt retry loop (sleep 25 ms more each time) survives Windows file
  contention from antivirus/indexers.
- Events also live in an in-memory list; `getRedFlagCount()` counts red ones —
  the ALERTS pill reads it.

### 3) core/ExamSession.java — one exam

```java
package com.cheatguard.core;

import com.cheatguard.config.AppPaths;

import java.io.File;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;

/** One exam session, its student folder, lifecycle times and audit log. */
public class ExamSession {
    private final String courseCode;
    private final String studentId;
    private final File examFolder;
    private final File sessionFile;
    private final LogManager logManager;
    private final LocalDateTime startTime;
    private LocalDateTime endTime;

    public ExamSession(String courseCode, String studentId) {
        this.courseCode = sanitize(courseCode);
        this.studentId = sanitize(studentId);
        this.examFolder = AppPaths.getExamFolder(this.studentId);
        this.startTime = LocalDateTime.now();

        File dir = AppPaths.getVaultDirectory();
        String stamp = startTime.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyyMMdd_HHmmss"));
        this.sessionFile = new File(dir, this.courseCode + "_Student" + this.studentId + "_" + stamp + ".dat");
        this.logManager = new LogManager(this.sessionFile);
        logManager.record(new Violation("SESSION_START",
                "Course=" + this.courseCode + " | StudentID=" + this.studentId +
                        " | ExamFolder=" + examFolder.getAbsolutePath(), Violation.Severity.INFO));
    }

    public synchronized void endSession() {
        if (endTime != null) return;
        endTime = LocalDateTime.now();
        long seconds = Math.max(0, Duration.between(startTime, endTime).getSeconds());
        logManager.record(new Violation("SESSION_END",
                "Course=" + courseCode + " | StudentID=" + studentId +
                        " | DurationSeconds=" + seconds, Violation.Severity.INFO));
    }

    private static String sanitize(String value) {
        String v = value == null ? "unknown" : value.trim();
        v = v.replaceAll("[^A-Za-z0-9._-]", "_");
        return v.isEmpty() ? "unknown" : v;
    }

    public String getSessionId() { return courseCode + " / " + studentId; }
    public String getCourseCode() { return courseCode; }
    public String getStudentId() { return studentId; }
    public File getExamFolder() { return examFolder; }
    public File getSessionFile() { return sessionFile; }
    public LogManager getLogManager() { return logManager; }
    public LocalDateTime getStartTime() { return startTime; }
    public LocalDateTime getEndTime() { return endTime; }
}
```

**What to notice:**
- `sanitize()` keeps only `A-Za-z0-9._-` — a crafted student ID cannot escape
  the folder name.
- The log file name has course + student + timestamp, inside the vault folder.
- The constructor immediately records SESSION_START; `endSession()` records
  SESSION_END with `DurationSeconds`, which the dashboard later parses.

### 4) core/AppLog.java — the app's own diary

```java
package com.cheatguard.core;

import com.cheatguard.config.AppPaths;

import java.io.File;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;

/**
 * Application diagnostics log, used by support tooling and the development team to
 * understand what happened on a machine after the fact.
 *
 * <p>Lines land in {@code <data>\logs\cheatguard-YYYY-MM-DD.log} and the console.
 * The packaged build has no console, so the file is the record; logs older than two
 * weeks are pruned automatically. Every writer failure is swallowed — diagnostics
 * must never break the application that is being diagnosed.
 */
public final class AppLog {

    private static final DateTimeFormatter STAMP = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS");
    private static final int KEEP_DAYS = 14;

    private AppLog() {
    }

    /** Route uncaught exceptions (worker threads and the Swing event thread) into the log. */
    public static void installCrashHandlers() {
        Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler((thread, throwable) ->
                write("ERROR", "Uncaught exception on thread '" + thread.getName() + "'", throwable));
        // Swing swallows EDT exceptions unless this legacy hook class is present.
        try {
            System.setProperty("sun.awt.exception.handler", EdtHandler.class.getName());
        } catch (Exception ignored) {
        }
    }

    /** Swing event-thread hook; instantiated reflectively by AWT. */
    public static final class EdtHandler {
        public EdtHandler() {
        }

        public void handle(Throwable throwable) {
            write("ERROR", "Exception on the Swing event thread", throwable);
        }
    }

    public static void info(String message) {
        write("INFO", message, null);
    }

    public static void warn(String message) {
        write("WARN", message, null);
    }

    public static void error(String message, Throwable throwable) {
        write("ERROR", message, throwable);
    }

    private static void write(String level, String message, Throwable throwable) {
        String line = LocalDateTime.now().format(STAMP) + " " + level + " " + message;
        if (throwable != null) {
            line += " :: " + throwable.getClass().getName() + ": " + throwable.getMessage();
            StackTraceElement[] stack = throwable.getStackTrace();
            if (stack.length > 0) line += " @ " + stack[0];
        }
        System.err.println(line); // visible in development; the file covers packaged builds
        try {
            File dir = new File(AppPaths.getDataDirectory(), "logs");
            if (!dir.exists()) dir.mkdirs();
            File file = new File(dir, "cheatguard-" + LocalDate.now() + ".log");
            boolean fresh = !file.isFile();
            Files.writeString(file.toPath(), line + System.lineSeparator(),
                    StandardCharsets.UTF_8, StandardOpenOption.CREATE, StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
            if (fresh) prune(dir);
        } catch (Exception ignored) {
            // never let diagnostics break the app
        }
    }

    private static void prune(File dir) {
        File[] files = dir.listFiles((d, name) -> name.startsWith("cheatguard-") && name.endsWith(".log"));
        if (files == null) return;
        long cutoff = System.currentTimeMillis() - KEEP_DAYS * 24L * 3_600_000L;
        for (File f : files) {
            if (f.lastModified() < cutoff) {
                try {
                    Files.deleteIfExists(f.toPath());
                } catch (Exception ignored) {
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**What to notice:**
- `installCrashHandlers()` catches uncaught exceptions everywhere. The line
  `System.setProperty("sun.awt.exception.handler", ...)` is needed because
  Swing EATS exceptions on the UI thread unless this legacy hook exists.
- Every line goes to console AND `logs\cheatguard-date.log`; files older than
  14 days are pruned. All failures swallowed — diagnostics must never crash
  the app.

**What to notice:**
- `getDataDirectory()` → `%ProgramData%\CheatGuard` (machine-wide, protected
  from normal users) — overridable with `-Dcheatguard.data.dir` for tests.
- `interactiveProfile` / `interactiveDesktop` are passed in BEFORE elevation:
  the elevated process may run as a different admin, but the exam folder must
  land on the STUDENT's desktop. `getDesktopDirectory()` tries the captured
  folder first, then `profile\Desktop`, then the OneDrive-safe
  `FileSystemView` home directory.
- `migrateLegacyProfileData()` copies an older layout into ProgramData once —
  old files are left in place, existing targets are never overwritten.

**What to notice:**
- **Singleton**: private constructor + one static instance + synchronized
  getter — the whole program shares ONE allowlist.
- `DEFAULT_PROCESSES` / `DEFAULT_SITES` are the built-in coding-test lists.
  The `allowlist.defaults.version` marker merges them into an OLD config once;
  after that, anything the admin removed stays removed.
- `isSiteAllowed()`: equals an entry OR ends with `.entry` — subdomains work.
- `normalizeSite()` ends with a REGEX that demands a real domain shape —
  without it, a bare "com" entry would allow nearly every site (because of the
  subdomain rule). `normalizeProcess()` adds `.exe` when missing.
- **Defaults version 3/4 notes**: version 3 removed the Google login/search/mail
  sites (accounts.google.com, google.com, gmail.com - the subdomain rule would
  otherwise have kept accounts.google.com allowed through google.com); version 4
  made the site list start EMPTY on every install, so the invigilator adds the
  exam sites one by one. Apps also carry a display-name map
  (`appname.code.exe=Visual Studio Code`) so lists and logs show real app names.

Walks the Start Menu folders (machine-wide and the user's own) collecting
shortcut files: a shortcut's file name IS the app's real display name, and the
target exe is resolved on demand with the WScript.Shell COM object, so the walk
stays fast even with hundreds of apps installed.

```

**What to notice:**
- `createPassword()` refuses if a password already exists.
- `check()`: empty input returns "wrong, 5 attempts left" WITHOUT touching the
  store — an empty submit is a typo, not a guessing attempt, and costs no
  PBKDF2 run. `finally` wipes the array — this is the char[] hygiene rule.
- `requireStrength()`: 8+ characters, must contain letters AND something else
  (number/symbol).

/**
 * On-disk store for the administrator password.
 *
 * <p>Design goals, in order:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>The password cannot be recovered from anything that ships.</b> Only a
 *       PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 digest with a random 16-byte salt and a high iteration
 *       count is written. There is no default password anywhere in the source, the
 *       jar or the installer, so decompiling the application or reading the
 *       repository reveals nothing usable.</li>
 *   <li><b>The record cannot be moved between computers.</b> Every record carries
 *       an HMAC keyed by this machine's identity, so a credential file taken from
 *       a machine whose password is known is rejected here.</li>
 *   <li><b>Failed attempts cannot be wiped by editing the file.</b> The attempt
 *       counter and lockout deadline are inside the authenticated payload.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Known boundary: an attacker with local administrator rights can delete the
 * file and run first-time setup again. That gives them a <em>new</em> password, not
 * the old one, and every session log already sealed with the previous password
 * stays unreadable. Preventing even that requires a server-side account, which is
 * what the planned university portal will provide.

**What to notice — the stored line is:**
```
cg1|210000|salt|hash|failedAttempts|lockoutTime|HMAC
```
- `save()`: new 16-byte `SecureRandom` salt → PBKDF2 (210,000 rounds) → write
  → `attrib +h` hides the file.
- `verify()`: first the HMAC (keyed with the PC's MachineGuid — any edit or
  PC-move breaks it) → then the lockout time → then derive the candidate hash
  and compare with `MessageDigest.isEqual` (constant time — no timing leak).
- Failure #5 starts a lockout of 30 s × 2^(extra failures), capped at 15 min.
  The counter lives INSIDE the signed payload — wiping it breaks the HMAC.
- `machineIdentity()` reads MachineGuid from the registry, falling back to
  computer + user name.

**What to notice:**
- File layout: `[16-byte salt][16-byte IV][AES ciphertext]`.
- Fresh salt + IV per file: the same password gives a different key for every
  log.
- `spec.clearPassword()` in `finally` — the password chars are wiped from the
  key spec after the key is derived.

**What to notice:**
- Streams the file in 8 KB chunks — a big log never sits in memory whole.
- `verify()` recomputes and compares ignoring case. One byte changed →
  mismatch → the dashboard reports "tampered".
- The comments are in Banglish — we wrote learning notes right in the code.

                    "Windows did not grant permission to delete this protected log.");
        }
        for (File target : targets) {
            if (target.exists()) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("The protected log could not be deleted.");
            }
        }
    }

    private void requireAdmin(char[] password) {
        // check() wipes the array it is given, so it must receive a copy - the
        // caller's array is still needed unchanged for the actual encryption.
        char[] probe = password == null ? new char[0] : password.clone();

```

**What to notice:**
- **Facade pattern**: it holds the encryptor, the signer and the lock manager,
  and offers four simple verbs: protect, seal, open, delete.
- `sealVault()`: release lock → verify password → encrypt → sign → delete the
  plaintext (with `deleteOnExit` fallback) → hide the new files.
- `openLog()`: an unsealed `.dat` reads directly (crash recovery); a `.vault`
  verifies the SIGNATURE first, then decrypts, then zeroes the plain bytes.
- `requireAdmin()` verifies a CLONE of the password: `check()` wipes the array
  it receives, but the encryption still needs the original.

### 12) security/FileLockManager.java — why lock only byte 0?

```java
package com.cheatguard.security;

import com.cheatguard.core.AppLog;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.RandomAccessFile;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
import java.nio.channels.FileLock;

/**
 * Keeps the active plaintext log open and locks only a tiny guard range.
 *
 * Why not lock the whole file?
 * On Windows a whole-file lock also blocks this application's own append
 * writer when it opens a second handle, producing:
 * "The process cannot access the file because another process has locked a portion of the file".
 *
 * Locking byte 0 keeps an OS-level guard while allowing append writes after
 * the existing content. The open RandomAccessFile handle also remains alive
 * for the full exam session and is released before sealing the vault.
 */
public class FileLockManager {
    private RandomAccessFile raf;
    private FileChannel channel;
    private FileLock lock;

    public synchronized boolean lockFile(File file) {
        releaseLock();
        try {
            raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, "rw");
            channel = raf.getChannel();
            // Guard only the first byte instead of the entire file.
            lock = channel.lock(0L, 1L, false);
            return true;
        } catch (IOException | RuntimeException e) {
            AppLog.warn("Could not protect active log: " + e.getMessage());
            releaseLock();
            return false;
        }
    }

    public synchronized void releaseLock() {
        try {
            if (lock != null && lock.isValid()) lock.release();
        } catch (IOException ignored) {
        } finally {
            lock = null;
        }
        try {
            if (channel != null && channel.isOpen()) channel.close();
        } catch (IOException ignored) {
        } finally {
            channel = null;
        }
        try {
            if (raf != null) raf.close();
        } catch (IOException ignored) {
        } finally {
            raf = null;
        }
    }
}
```

**What to notice:**
- `channel.lock(0L, 1L, false)` locks ONLY the first byte. A whole-file lock
  blocked our OWN appender with "file locked" errors — one byte guards the
  file at OS level while our writes continue after existing content.
- `synchronized` methods; `releaseLock()` is safe to call repeatedly and is
  called from the failure path too.

### 13) security/InstanceGuard.java — one app at a time

```java
package com.cheatguard.security;

import com.cheatguard.config.AppPaths;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.RandomAccessFile;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
import java.nio.channels.FileLock;

/** Prevents two Cheat.Guard processes from running at the same time. */
public final class InstanceGuard {
    private RandomAccessFile raf;
    private FileChannel channel;
    private FileLock lock;

    public boolean acquire() {
        try {
            File f = new File(AppPaths.getDataDirectory(), "instance.lock");
            raf = new RandomAccessFile(f, "rw");
            channel = raf.getChannel();
            lock = channel.tryLock();
            if (lock == null) {
                close();
                return false;
            }
            return true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            close();
            return false;
        }
    }

    public void close() {
        try { if (lock != null && lock.isValid()) lock.release(); } catch (Exception ignored) {}
        try { if (channel != null && channel.isOpen()) channel.close(); } catch (Exception ignored) {}
        try { if (raf != null) raf.close(); } catch (Exception ignored) {}
        lock = null; channel = null; raf = null;
    }
}
```

**What to notice:**
- `tryLock()` on a small lock file: if it is not free, another copy is running
  → refuse. The lock dies with the JVM, so no cleanup file is needed.

### 14) security/LogProtection.java — talking to the helper through files

 * <p>A sealed log is only evidence if it survives. Once a session ends, the
 * elevated helper that is already running for the network lockdown re-owns the
 * {@code .vault} and {@code .vault.sig} files to the Administrators group, drops
 * inherited permissions and leaves the signed-in account with <em>read</em> access
 * only. A student — or anyone using the desktop normally — then cannot delete,
 * rename or edit them: Explorer refuses, and because the account no longer owns the
 * files it cannot grant itself permission back either.
 *
 * <p>Deleting a log stays possible, but only the intended way: through the admin
 * dashboard, after the administrator password, which then asks Windows for elevation.
 *
 * <p>Boundary worth stating: a machine administrator who deliberately elevates can
 * always override file permissions. What this removes is deletion by a standard
 * user, by accident, or by anyone poking around in the folder.

}
```

**What to notice:**
- `protectViaHelper()`: writes the file paths into a request file; the running
  elevated helper applies `takeown` + `icacls` (Administrators full, SYSTEM
  full, Users read-only) and writes a done marker; we poll for 20 s.
- `deleteElevated()`: the paths travel in a TEMP FILE so no quoting can corrupt
  the elevated PowerShell command; it grants Administrators full then
  `Remove-Item`s each path, and the temp file deletes itself.

## A4. OOP concepts in my part (with the real places)

1. **Encapsulation** — `Violation`: private final fields, read-only getters.
   `AdminCredentialStore`: the password file only through its own methods.
2. **Singleton** — `AppConfig.getInstance()`: private constructor + one static
   instance; the whole program shares one allowlist.
3. **Immutable objects** — `Violation` has no setters: a fact never changes.
4. **Static factory methods** — `Result.ok()`, `Result.wrong()`,
   `Result.lockedOut()` in the credential store.
5. **Composition (has-a)** — `SecurityVault` HAS an encryptor, a signer, a
   lock manager; each small class does one job.
6. **Exception hierarchy** — `IllegalArgumentException` (weak input),
   `SecurityException` (wrong password), `IOException` (files) — caught
   separately, each with its own message.
7. **Abstraction** — `AppPaths` hides WHERE files live; nobody builds raw
   paths by hand.

## A5. Technologies in my part

PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (210,000 rounds) · 16-byte salt · HMAC + MachineGuid
(machine binding) · AES-256-CBC with per-file salt+IV · SHA-256 signatures ·
char[] zero-fill (never String) · SecureRandom · file-channel locks ·
properties files · constant-time compare · attrib/icacls/takeown.

## A6. Questions Sir may ask me

**Q: Why PBKDF2 and not a plain SHA-256 of the password?**
A: Plain SHA-256 is instant — billions of guesses per second. PBKDF2 repeats
the hashing 210,000 times, so every guess is slow, and with a salt there is no
pre-computed table.

**Q: What is a salt?**
A: Random bytes mixed with the password before hashing, so the same password
gives a different hash every time. It defeats "rainbow" tables.

**Q: Why no default password?**
A: A default would be visible in the code after decompiling. First launch
creates one; only its hash is stored.

**Q: What if someone copies the password file to another PC?**
A: It fails — the HMAC uses this PC's MachineGuid. The app rejects it and asks
for a new password.

**Q: What if the student deletes the log during the exam?**
A: They cannot — the log's permissions are hardened at session start; after
sealing it is also encrypted, signed, and ACL-locked.

**Q: What if the app dies mid-exam?**
A: Every event was already on disk. The leftover file stays as an UNSEALED
log, clearly marked; the next start repairs any leftover lockdown.

**Handover:** "That was the data and the security. Now my teammate explains the
engine that actually blocks things during the exam."

# PART B — MEMBER 2: The Blocking Engine (15 files + the PowerShell helper)

## B1. What I say (about 3 minutes)

"My part is the watchdog engine — everything that blocks and watches while the
exam runs. Four things: websites, programs, folders, devices.

Websites are the main one. Every program that opens a website must first ask a
DNS server for its address. Our program runs its own tiny DNS server inside the
student's computer on 127.0.0.1 port 53. An admin PowerShell helper points
every network card of the machine at it. Now every question comes to us: an
allowed name gets a real answer, everything else gets 'does not exist'. The
site cannot open — for every program, not just the browser.

Students try escapes, and we close them. Browser DNS-over-HTTPS is turned off
by policy AND blocked in the firewall. Direct queries to public DNS servers and
DNS-over-TLS are blocked. VPN and remote-control programs — OpenVPN, WireGuard,
TeamViewer, AnyDesk, VNC and about thirty more — are closed wherever they are
installed, and their network ports are blocked. The strongest layer: the
firewall refuses ALL web traffic by default and only allows the addresses that
approved websites really resolved to — so even typing a raw IP fails. Before
arming that mode we VERIFY an approved site is reachable; on a strange network
it rolls back safely and the log records which mode ran.

Then programs: anything new that opens during the exam and is not allowed is
closed, and the closing is logged. Programs the student compiles into their own
exam folder are never touched. And the ALLOWED apps start fresh: at session
start they are closed too, and the invigilator reopens the needed ones from the
monitor screen, which launches them ON the exam folder — so no folder, file or
tab opened before the exam survives inside them. Then we watch what those apps
DO: an editor whose tab title shows a foreign folder is a red alert; a
permitted interpreter (python) whose command line names a file outside the exam
folder is closed and logged red; and an allowed app showing a file outside the
exam folder is closed and logged red. The Windows recent-files lists (Start
menu, jump lists, Open-dialog recents) are wiped at start, so nothing pre-exam
can be reopened in one click. And the strongest content wall: the student's
ACCOUNT itself is denied read access to everything outside the exam folder
(Documents, Downloads, other drives, USB) with NTFS permissions - so no
program, terminal or dialog can open a pre-exam file at all. Everything is
restored at the end. Folders: an Explorer window outside the exam folder is a
red flag. USB devices: a stick, a USB network adapter, or a phone in file mode
is an instant alert.

One important ordering: at session start the app kills all background apps
FIRST and only then starts counting alerts — cleanup noise never becomes a fake
alarm. And the student cannot kill our app: it runs elevated, and Windows (UIPI)
blocks normal programs from touching an elevated process. My teammate will now
show the screens and how we tested everything."

  never blamed on the student.
- `BACKGROUND_TOOL_NAMES`: Windows platform processes that appear on their own.
- `FORCED_CLOSE` + prefixes: the VPN / remote-control kill list — judged
  ANYWHERE on disk, because they bypass the DNS filter completely.

     */
```

- `startupKillSweep()` runs FIRST (before any baseline) — the session contract:
  kill everything student-space, then start counting.
- The folder/device baseline and process baseline are taken AFTER the sweep.
- One cycle every 1.2 s; folders every 2nd cycle, devices every 4th (PowerShell
  probes cost CPU — spacing keeps the profile low).

**Part 3 — the startup sweep:**

```java
    private void startupKillSweep() {
        List<String> systemPrefixes = buildSystemPrefixes();
        for (ProcessHandle ph : ProcessHandle.allProcesses().toList()) {
            if (ph.pid() <= 4 || ph.pid() == selfPid) continue;
            String command = ph.info().command().orElse("");
            if (command.isBlank()) continue; // not attributable: the sweeps re-check it

            String name = new File(command).getName().toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);
            if (!name.endsWith(".exe")) name = name + ".exe";
            if (name.equals("cheatguard.exe")) continue;
            boolean forced = isForcedClose(name);
            if (!forced && whitelist.isSystemProcess(name)) continue;
            if (OWN_TOOL_NAMES.contains(name) || BACKGROUND_TOOL_NAMES.contains(name)) continue;

            String lowerCmd = command.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);
            boolean browser = whitelist.isBrowser(name);
            boolean approved = whitelist.isAllowed(name);
            boolean inSystemArea = false;
            for (String prefix : systemPrefixes) {
                if (lowerCmd.startsWith(prefix)) { inSystemArea = true; break; }
            }
            // APPROVED apps are closed too, wherever they sit: a fresh start means
            // no folder, file or tab opened before the exam survives inside them.
            // The invigilator reopens the ones this exam needs from the monitor
            // screen, which launches them ON the exam folder.
            if (!browser && !approved && !forced && inSystemArea) continue;

            String app = ProcessWhitelist.friendlyName(name);
            // taskkill can race an app that is already shutting down (VS Code runs as
            // several processes) - the process being gone counts as closed.
            boolean closed = controller.terminate(ph.pid()) || !ph.isAlive();
            if (closed) {
                emit(new Violation("APP_CLOSED_AT_START", app, Violation.Severity.INFO));
            } else {
                emit(new Violation("UNAUTHORIZED_APP_CLOSE_FAILED", app, Violation.Severity.CRITICAL));
            }
        }
    }

    /** Every process alive when monitoring starts is baseline, whichever session it sits in. */
```

- For every process: skip system idle/self, skip our own exe, skip Windows
  components, skip our own helper tools — and CLOSE THE ALLOWED APPS TOO,
  wherever they sit (VS Code in Program Files included). That is the fresh-start
  rule: a folder, file or tab opened before the exam cannot survive inside an
  approved app. The invigilator reopens what the exam needs from the monitor
  screen, which starts them ON the exam folder. Browsers are judged wherever
  they are installed; everything else in a student-writable area is closed with
  `taskkill` and logged as "Closed before exam" (or red if the close fails).

**Part 4 — baseline, forced-close check, process identity:**

```java
    private void snapshotProcessBaseline() {
        try {
            ProcessHandle.allProcesses().forEach(ph -> knownPids.add(processKey(ph)));
        } catch (Exception ignored) {
            // the visible-window sweep below still runs; background sweep just starts fresh
        }
    }

    /** True for tunnelling/remote-control clients, wherever they are installed. */
    private static boolean isForcedClose(String processName) {
        if (processName == null) return false;
        String p = processName.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);
        if (FORCED_CLOSE.contains(p)) return true;
        for (String prefix : FORCED_CLOSE_PREFIXES) {
            if (p.startsWith(prefix)) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    /**
     * Identity of a process across sweeps. The start instant is part of the key so a
     * recycled PID (one app closed, Windows hands the number to a new one) is judged
     * as the new process it actually is, not skipped as already seen.
     */
    private static String processKey(ProcessHandle ph) {
        long start = 0L;
        try {
            start = ph.info().startInstant().orElse(java.time.Instant.EPOCH).toEpochMilli();
        } catch (Exception ignored) {
        }
        return ph.pid() + "@" + start;
    }

    /**
     * Close student-started apps that never show a top-level window — the blind spot
     * of the visible-window sweep. Tray apps, minimized launches and headless
     * browsers (chrome --headless is a whole cheat toolkit) are invisible to
     * MainWindowTitle but appear here as new PIDs.
     *
     * <p>To keep collateral damage at zero, a process is only closed when it is NEW
     * (started after the baseline), its name is not a known Windows shell/background
     * component, and its executable lives OUTSIDE the machine's system locations
     * (Windows directory, Program Files, ProgramData) — everywhere else is somewhere
     * a standard user can drop a file, including a second drive's root. Browser
     * binaries are judged wherever they sit, because a headless browser is a cheat
     * toolkit even when installed system-wide.
     */
```

- `processKey` = PID + start instant — the fix for recycled PIDs: Windows hands
  the same number to a new program, and the start time tells them apart.
- `isForcedClose` matches the exact set OR the vendor prefixes (nordlynx,
  warp-svc, tailscale-ipn…).

**Part 5 — background process sweep (the blind-spot killer):**

```java
    private void checkBackgroundProcesses() {
        List<String> systemPrefixes = buildSystemPrefixes();
        for (ProcessHandle ph : ProcessHandle.allProcesses().toList()) {

            if (ph.pid() <= 4 || ph.pid() == selfPid || knownPids.contains(key)) continue;

            String command = ph.info().command().orElse("");
            if (command.isBlank()) continue; // not yet attributable: re-judged next sweep
            knownPids.add(key); // judge once per actual process; never re-log it

            // Programs the student builds into their own exam folder ARE the exam work
            // (a compiled solution runs from there all session long) — never touched.

            if (approved && !forced) {

- Only NEW keys are judged (`knownPids`) — each process is judged once.
- A blank command line means "not attributable yet" — skipped and re-checked
  next sweep instead of guessed.
- `isExamWorkspaceBinary(path)`: anything running from the student's exam
  folder is NEVER touched — that is the compiled homework rule.

**Part 6 — the visible-window sweep:**

```java
    private void checkProcesses() {

            // window title carries a drive path outside that folder (a file it has

            boolean skip = !flagged
                    && ((!forced && whitelist.isAllowed(proc.getName()))
                        || isExamWorkspaceBinary(proc.getImagePath()));

            boolean closed = controller.terminate(proc.getPid()) || gone;
            String app = ProcessWhitelist.friendlyName(proc.getName());

        }
        recentlyBlockedPids.clear();
        recentlyBlockedPids.addAll(stillVisibleBlocked);
        baselineSweepDone = true;
    }

```

- First sweep (before `baselineSweepDone`) logs "Closed before exam" (grey);
  later closes are grey OK, close-FAILURES are red ALERTS.
- `recentlyBlockedPids` stops the same window being re-logged every cycle.

**Part 7 — folders, devices, and the emit gate:**

            }
        }
    }
}
```

- Folders: only NEW bad paths (never seen before) raise the red flag.
- `emit()` deduplicates INFO rows by type+description — one row per program per
  session. CRITICAL always passes. Then: log to file + notify the listener.

- The 60-second startup grace: blocked lookups in the first minute are the
  machine's own dying apps, not the student — dropped silently.
- `BLOCKED_PUBLIC_RESOLVERS`: if the machine was using 8.8.8.8 etc., those
  upstreams are dropped from OUR list (they are firewalled for students; the
  filter must never block its own path). The fallbacks are Quad9 "unfiltered"
  IPs, deliberately OUTSIDE that block list.

     */
    public DnsAllowlistServer(LogManager logManager, ViolationListener listener,
                              List<String> systemUpstreams, File allowedIpSink) {
        this.logManager = logManager;
        this.listener = listener;
        this.allowedIpSink = allowedIpSink;
        List<String> cleaned = new ArrayList<>();

                if (s == null || !s.matches("\\d{1,3}(\\.\\d{1,3}){3}")) continue;

     */
```

- Three constructors chain with `this(...)` (constructor overloading). The
  longest one cleans the upstream list: valid IPv4 only, not in the blocked
  set, no loopback, maximum 4, then appends the fallbacks.
- `CachedAnswer` is a Java **record** — an immutable data holder in one line.

**Part 3 — start() and close():**

```java
    public void start() throws IOException {
        if (running.get()) return;
        socket = new DatagramSocket(new InetSocketAddress(InetAddress.getByName("127.0.0.1"), DNS_PORT));
        socket.setSoTimeout(1000);
        try {
            socketV6 = new DatagramSocket(new InetSocketAddress(InetAddress.getByName("::1"), DNS_PORT));
            socketV6.setSoTimeout(1000);
        } catch (Exception ipv6Unavailable) {
            socketV6 = null;
        }
        running.set(true);
        workers = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(8, r -> {
            Thread t = new Thread(r, "CheatGuard-DNS-Worker");
            t.setDaemon(true);
            return t;
        });
        startAcceptThread(socket, "CheatGuard-DNS");
        if (socketV6 != null) startAcceptThread(socketV6, "CheatGuard-DNS-v6");
        if (allowedIpSink != null) {
            ipFlusher = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor(r -> {
                Thread t = new Thread(r, "CheatGuard-IpSink");
                t.setDaemon(true);
                return t;
            });
            ipFlusher.scheduleWithFixedDelay(this::flushAllowedIps, 3, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        }
    }

    /** True when ::1:53 is also being served, so IPv6 DNS can be redirected too. */
    public boolean isIpv6Bound() {
        return socketV6 != null;
    }

    private void startAcceptThread(DatagramSocket bound, String name) {
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> acceptLoop(bound), name);
        t.setDaemon(true);
        acceptThreads.add(t);
        t.start();
    }

    public boolean isRunning() {
        return running.get();
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        running.set(false);
        DatagramSocket s = socket;
        if (s != null) s.close();
        socket = null;
        DatagramSocket s6 = socketV6;
        if (s6 != null) s6.close();
        socketV6 = null;
        if (workers != null) {
            workers.shutdownNow();
            try {
                workers.awaitTermination(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
            workers = null;
        }
        for (Thread t : acceptThreads) t.interrupt();
        acceptThreads.clear();
        if (ipFlusher != null) {
            ipFlusher.shutdown();
            flushAllowedIps(); // leave the helper the last known list
            ipFlusher = null;
        }
        loggedBlockedHosts.clear();
        answerCache.clear();
    }

```

- Binds UDP 53 on 127.0.0.1 AND ::1; `setSoTimeout(1000)` makes the accept loop
  wake up every second so it can notice `running = false`.
- A pool of 8 worker threads answers packets — one slow upstream cannot freeze
  the others.
- `close()` shuts everything down in order and writes the final IP file.

**Part 4 — receiving a packet:**

```java
    private void acceptLoop(DatagramSocket bound) {
        while (running.get()) {
            byte[] buf = new byte[MAX_PACKET];
            DatagramPacket request = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length);
            try {
                bound.receive(request);
                ExecutorService pool = workers;
                if (pool != null) pool.submit(() -> handle(request, bound));
            } catch (SocketTimeoutException ignored) {
                // periodic wake-up so the running flag is re-checked
            } catch (Exception e) {
                if (running.get() && !bound.isClosed()) {
                    // transient receive failure; keep serving
                    continue;
                }
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    private void handle(DatagramPacket request, DatagramSocket bound) {
        byte[] query = new byte[request.getLength()];
        System.arraycopy(request.getData(), request.getOffset(), query, 0, request.getLength());

        String host = parseQName(query);
        boolean allowed = host != null && AppConfig.getInstance().isSiteAllowed(host);

        byte[] response;
        if (allowed) {
            response = resolveApproved(query, host);
        } else {
            response = buildResponse(query, RCODE_NXDOMAIN);
            if (host != null) recordBlocked(host);
        }

        if (response == null) return;
        try {
            if (!bound.isClosed()) {
                bound.send(new DatagramPacket(response, response.length,
                        request.getAddress(), request.getPort()));
            }
        } catch (IOException ignored) {
            // client went away
        }
    }

    /**
     * Answer an approved lookup: replay a recent identical answer when one is
     * cached, otherwise forward upstream. Caching collapses a browser's burst of
     * repeated lookups (page + assets + safe-browsing refreshes) into a single
     * upstream round-trip and makes approved pages load noticeably faster.
     */
```

- `parseQName` reads the question name; `isSiteAllowed` decides; allowed →
  `resolveApproved`, otherwise → NXDOMAIN reply + `recordBlocked`.

**Part 5 — resolving an allowed name:**

```java
    private byte[] resolveApproved(byte[] query, String host) {
        String key = cacheKey(query, host);
        if (key != null) {
            CachedAnswer cached = answerCache.get(key);
            if (cached != null && cached.expiresAt() > System.currentTimeMillis()) {
                collectIps(parseAnswerIps(cached.response()));
                return withQueryId(cached.response(), query);
            }
            if (cached != null) answerCache.remove(key);
        }

        byte[] response = forward(query);
        if (response != null && key != null && answerCount(response) > 0) {
            collectIps(parseAnswerIps(response));
            if (answerCache.size() >= CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES) answerCache.clear();
            answerCache.put(key, new CachedAnswer(withQueryId(response, new byte[]{0, 0}),
                    System.currentTimeMillis() + CACHE_TTL_MS));
        }
        return response;
    }

    /** Record addresses served for approved domains; the egress firewall follows them. */
    private void collectIps(List<String> ips) {
        if (allowedIpSink == null || ips.isEmpty()) return;
        synchronized (allowedAnswerIps) {
            if (allowedAnswerIps.size() >= 512) allowedAnswerIps.clear(); // bounded CDN churn
        }
        allowedAnswerIps.addAll(ips);
        ipListDirty = true;
    }

    /** Rewrite the sink file when new approved addresses have been seen. */
    private void flushAllowedIps() {
        if (!ipListDirty || allowedIpSink == null) return;
        ipListDirty = false;
        List<String> snapshot;
        synchronized (allowedAnswerIps) {
            snapshot = new ArrayList<>(allowedAnswerIps);
        }
        try {
            Files.write(allowedIpSink.toPath(),
                    (String.join("\n", snapshot) + "\n").getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            ipListDirty = true;
        }
    }

    /** IPv4/IPv6 addresses carried by a successful upstream answer (A and AAAA records). */
```

- Cache first (30 s TTL) — a hit is returned with the CLIENT's own transaction
  ID written back in (`withQueryId`).
- On a miss: `forward()` → validate → collect the answer IPs for the firewall
  file → store in the cache.
- `flushAllowedIps()` rewrites the IP file (dirty flag set on new addresses) —
  a scheduled executor calls it every 3 seconds.

**Part 6 — extracting addresses from a DNS answer, byte by byte:**

```java
    public static List<String> parseAnswerIps(byte[] msg) {
        List<String> out = new ArrayList<>();
        if (msg == null || msg.length < 12) return out;
        int questions = ((msg[4] & 0xFF) << 8) | (msg[5] & 0xFF);
        int answers = ((msg[6] & 0xFF) << 8) | (msg[7] & 0xFF);
        int pos = 12;
        for (int i = 0; i < questions && pos < msg.length; i++) {
            int next = skipName(msg, pos);
            if (next < 0) return out;
            pos = next + 4; // QTYPE + QCLASS
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < answers && pos + 10 <= msg.length; i++) {
            int next = skipName(msg, pos);
            if (next < 0) return out;
            pos = next;
            int type = ((msg[pos] & 0xFF) << 8) | (msg[pos + 1] & 0xFF);
            int rdlength = ((msg[pos + 8] & 0xFF) << 8) | (msg[pos + 9] & 0xFF);
            pos += 10;
            if (pos + rdlength > msg.length) return out;
            if (type == 1 && rdlength == 4) {
                out.add((msg[pos] & 0xFF) + "." + (msg[pos + 1] & 0xFF) + "."
                        + (msg[pos + 2] & 0xFF) + "." + (msg[pos + 3] & 0xFF));
            } else if (type == 28 && rdlength == 16) {
                byte[] addr = new byte[16];
                System.arraycopy(msg, pos, addr, 0, 16);
                try {
                    out.add(InetAddress.getByAddress(addr).getHostAddress());
                } catch (Exception ignored) {
                    // a malformed AAAA record is skipped, the rest still count
                }
            }
            pos += rdlength;
        }
        return out;
    }

    /** Index just past a possibly compressed name; -1 when the message is malformed. */
    private static int skipName(byte[] msg, int pos) {
        while (pos < msg.length) {
            int len = msg[pos] & 0xFF;
            if (len == 0) return pos + 1;
            if ((len & 0xC0) == 0xC0) return pos + 2 <= msg.length ? pos + 2 : -1;

    /**
     * Cache key: the question name and type. The query ID is excluded on purpose —
     * cached answers are served with each requester's own ID written back in.
     */
```

- The header is 12 bytes; question and answer names may use "compression
  pointers" (`0xC0...`) — `skipName` handles both plain labels and pointers.
- Type 1 = A record (4 bytes, printed dotted), type 28 = AAAA (16 bytes,
  converted with `InetAddress.getByAddress`).

**Part 7 — cache key, ID rewrite, counters:**

```java
    private static String cacheKey(byte[] query, String host) {
        if (host == null) return null;
        int qtype = questionType(query);
        if (qtype < 0) return null;
        return host + "/" + qtype;
    }

    /** Write the two ID bytes of {@code idSource} into a copy of {@code response}. */
    private static byte[] withQueryId(byte[] response, byte[] idSource) {
        byte[] out = response.clone();
        out[0] = idSource[0];
        out[1] = idSource[1];
        return out;
    }

    /** ANCOUNT of a DNS message, or -1 when the header is malformed. */
    private static int answerCount(byte[] msg) {
        if (msg.length < 12) return -1;
        return ((msg[6] & 0xFF) << 8) | (msg[7] & 0xFF);
    }

    /** QTYPE of the first question, or -1. */
    private static int questionType(byte[] msg) {
        if (msg.length < 12) return -1;
        int pos = 12;
        while (pos < msg.length) {
            int len = msg[pos] & 0xFF;
            if (len == 0) break;
            if ((len & 0xC0) != 0) return -1;
            pos++;
            if (pos + len > msg.length) return -1;
            pos += len;
        }
        if (pos + 4 > msg.length) return -1;
        return ((msg[pos] & 0xFF) << 8) | (msg[pos + 1] & 0xFF);
    }

    /**
     * Resolve an approved domain through a system or public resolver.
     *
     * <p>The upstream socket is CONNECTED so the kernel discards datagrams from any
     * source other than the resolver itself, and every reply is validated against
     * the request (matching ID, question name and question type) before it is used.
     * Without these checks an attacker on the exam LAN could race spoofed replies
     * and point an approved domain at a server they control.
     */
```

- The cache key deliberately EXCLUDES the transaction ID — each client gets its
  own ID written back in.

**Part 8 — forwarding and anti-spoofing:**

```java
    private byte[] forward(byte[] query) {
        for (String upstream : upstreams) {
            try (DatagramSocket up = new DatagramSocket()) {
                up.setSoTimeout(UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT_MS);
                InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(upstream);
                up.connect(addr, DNS_PORT);
                up.send(new DatagramPacket(query, query.length, addr, DNS_PORT));
                byte[] buf = new byte[MAX_PACKET];
                DatagramPacket resp = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length);
                up.receive(resp);
                byte[] out = new byte[resp.getLength()];
                System.arraycopy(resp.getData(), 0, out, 0, resp.getLength());
                if (!responseMatchesQuery(out, query)) continue; // spoofed or garbled: next resolver
                return out;
            } catch (Exception ignored) {
                // try the next resolver
            }
        }
        return buildResponse(query, RCODE_SERVFAIL);
    }

    /** True when a reply is a usable answer to this exact query. */
    public static boolean responseMatchesQuery(byte[] reply, byte[] query) {
        if (reply.length < 12 || query.length < 12) return false;
        if (reply[0] != query[0] || reply[1] != query[1]) return false;   // transaction ID
        String asked = parseQName(query);
        String answered = parseQName(reply);
        if (asked == null || !asked.equals(answered)) return false;
        return questionType(reply) == questionType(query);
    }

    /**
     * Report a denied lookup. Background/telemetry lookups are dropped silently and
     * the startup settling window is quiet, so only deliberate student navigation is
     * recorded — as a NOTICE (yellow), because the block held and nothing opened.
     * A red flag stays reserved for things that actually got through.
     */
```

- The upstream socket is CONNECTED, so the OS itself drops datagrams from
  anyone else. `responseMatchesQuery` then checks ID + question name + question
  type — a forged answer fails all three.

**Part 9 — recording a blocked lookup:**

```java
    private void recordBlocked(String host) {
        if (System.currentTimeMillis() < graceUntil) return;
        if (loggedBlockedHosts.size() >= MAX_LOGGED_HOSTS) return;

        String userFacing = reporter.userFacingViolation(host);
        if (userFacing == null || userFacing.isEmpty()) return;
        if (!loggedBlockedHosts.add(userFacing)) return;

        Violation v = new Violation("BLOCKED_INTERNET_DOMAIN", userFacing,
                Violation.Severity.NOTICE);
        logManager.record(v);
        if (listener != null) listener.onViolation(v);
    }

    // ------------------------------------------------ minimal DNS wire format

    private static final int RCODE_SERVFAIL = 2;
    private static final int RCODE_NXDOMAIN = 3;

    /** Read the first question name from a query, lower-cased. */
    public static String parseQName(byte[] msg) {
        if (msg.length < 12) return null;
        int pos = 12;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (pos < msg.length) {
            int len = msg[pos] & 0xFF;
            if (len == 0) break;
            if ((len & 0xC0) != 0) return null; // compression pointer: not a plain question
            pos++;
            if (pos + len > msg.length) return null;
            if (sb.length() > 0) sb.append('.');
            for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) sb.append((char) (msg[pos + i] & 0xFF));
            pos += len;
        }
        return sb.length() == 0 ? null : sb.toString().toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);
    }

    /** Echo the question back with the supplied RCODE and no answer records. */
    private static byte[] buildResponse(byte[] query, int rcode) {
        if (query.length < 12) return null;
        int pos = 12;
        while (pos < query.length) {
            int len = query[pos] & 0xFF;
            pos++;
            if (len == 0) break;
            pos += len;
        }
        pos += 4; // QTYPE + QCLASS
        int questionEnd = Math.min(pos, query.length);

        ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        out.write(query[0]);
        out.write(query[1]);
        int rd = query[2] & 0x01;
        out.write(0x80 | rd);             // QR=1, RD copied
        out.write(0x80 | (rcode & 0x0F)); // RA=1 + RCODE
        out.write(0x00); out.write(0x01); // QDCOUNT = 1
        for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) out.write(0x00); // AN/NS/AR = 0
        for (int i = 12; i < questionEnd; i++) out.write(query[i]);
        return out.toByteArray();
    }
}
```

- Three gates before a row exists: the grace window, the noise reporter, the
  once-per-host set. What survives is a NOTICE (yellow) — the block held.
- `buildResponse` echoes the question with the RCODE set (3 = NXDOMAIN) and
  zero answers.

### 3) watchdog/StrictNetworkLockdown.java — the network lifecycle

- helper, config, ready, stop, restored, error, state, allowedIps,
  egressStatus — all inside the admin-protected network folder.

**Part 2 — start():**

```

- Copy the helper → clean markers → start the DNS server → identify user SID
  and exe path → seed the IP file → write the config → launch elevated → poll
  READY up to 90 s (UAC time) → on error.txt, surface the reason.

**Part 3 — starting the DNS server + the IPv6-leak guard:**

```java
    private void startDnsServer() throws IOException {
        dnsServer = new DnsAllowlistServer(logManager, listener, detectSystemUpstreams(), allowedIps);
        try {

```

- If ::1 cannot be bound while real IPv6 resolvers exist, the exam REFUSES to
  start — otherwise students could escape through IPv6.
- `detectSystemUpstreams` captures the machine's current resolvers (skipping
  loopback) so approved sites keep working on campus networks.

A note on private browsing: incognito windows use the same system DNS, the
same DoH-off policies and the same firewall - none of the layers care which
browser mode the student picks, so private windows get no bypass.

- `stopAndRestore()` writes stop.marker and waits up to 25 s for RESTORED —
  the return value says whether restore is CONFIRMED.
- `recoverStaleIfPresent()` (static, at app start): if a state file survived a
  crash, copy the CURRENT helper over the old one and launch it with
  `-RecoverOnly` — it restores from the snapshot.

- `writeConfig` builds the JSON the helper trusts (paths, parent PID, SID,
  verify host...).
- `seedAllowedIps()` resolves up to 6 allowed sites NOW (real DNS still active)
  so the firewall allowlist is populated BEFORE default-deny arms.
- `emitEgressStatus()` reads the helper's status file and logs whether the
  egress firewall armed or fell back.

        // block for the entire exam and the caller's ready.marker/error.txt polling
        // loop would never get a chance to run, eventually timing out even though
        // the helper actually started fine - leaving the firewall/proxy lockdown
        // active with nothing to signal success. UAC-decline is still surfaced
        // synchronously by Start-Process -Verb RunAs even without -Wait, so we don't
        // lose that error path.
        String command = "$ErrorActionPreference='Stop'; " +

        Process p = new ProcessBuilder("powershell.exe", "-NoProfile", "-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass", "-Command", command)
                .redirectErrorStream(true).start();
        boolean done;
        try {
            // This wrapper now returns as soon as the elevated process is launched
            // (or throws immediately if the UAC prompt is declined), so a short
            // timeout is enough - it is not waiting for the exam to end anymore.
            done = p.waitFor(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            throw new IOException("Interrupted while waiting for Administrator/UAC approval.", ie);
        }
        String out = new String(p.getInputStream().readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8).trim();
        if (!done) {
            p.destroyForcibly();
            throw new IOException("Administrator/UAC approval timed out.");
        }
        if (p.exitValue() != 0) {
            File helperError = new File(config.getParentFile(), "error.txt");

            if (detail.isEmpty()) detail = out;
            if (detail.isEmpty()) detail = "The elevated network helper did not launch (UAC declined or blocked). Check error.txt and Windows Event Viewer.";
            throw new IOException(detail);
        }
        // Launch succeeded; actual readiness/failure of network-lockdown.ps1 itself
        // is now reported via ready.marker / error.txt, which start() already polls.
    }

```

- `Start-Process -Verb RunAs -PassThru` WITHOUT `-Wait`: we only wait for the
  UAC decision (20 s); the helper keeps running for the whole exam and talks to
  us through marker files.

**Part 7 — the small utilities:**

```java
    private String currentUserSid() throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        Process p = new ProcessBuilder("powershell.exe", "-NoProfile", "-NonInteractive", "-WindowStyle", "Hidden", "-Command", "[System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().User.Value")
                .redirectErrorStream(true).start();
```

- `currentProgramPath` prefers the jpackage launcher (falling back to the
  java.exe path would give EVERY Java program firewall access — a bug we
  avoided on purpose). `jsonEscape`/`psSingleQuote` stop injection into the
  config/script.

- `-RecoverOnly` → restore + exit (crash recovery path).
- Normal run: verify program path → recover stale → SNAPSHOT → hide fast user
  switching → disable user proxy/PAC → DoH off → firewall rules (DoH IPs,
  DoT 853, public 53, allow our own exe, tunnel blocks, egress attempt) →
  redirect DNS on every adapter → VERIFY DNS → ACL the network folder → READY.
- The wait loop (every 500 ms): stop marker? parent alive? protect requests?
  every 10th loop refresh the allowed-IP rule? new adapter → redirect it?
- `catch` writes error.txt and RESTORES EVERYTHING anyway.

## B3. The other twelve files, full code

### 5) watchdog/ViolationListener.java — the contract

```java
package com.cheatguard.watchdog;

import com.cheatguard.core.Violation;

/**
 * OOP Concept: INTERFACE (abstraction)
 * --------------------------------------
 * WatchdogEngine ke direct AlarmPlayer/ScreenLocker class chinte hobe na.
 * Eta shudhu jane je "kono violation hole, ekta onVoilation() call hobe".
 * Main.java run-time e ekta implementation (lambda) diye WatchdogEngine ke
 * bole dey exactly ki korte hobe (alarm baja, screen lock kora, etc).
 * Eta "loose coupling" - alada module gula ek-onner shathe tightly bound thake na.
 */
public interface ViolationListener {
    void onViolation(Violation violation);
}
```

One method. The engine calls it without knowing the GUI — loose coupling.
Main implements it as a lambda; the tests pass null. (The Banglish comment
documents the OOP idea right in the code.)

### 6) watchdog/PowerShellUtil.java — safe probe launching

```java
package com.cheatguard.watchdog;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.util.Base64;

/** Starts small read-only PowerShell probes without Windows command-line quote corruption. */
final class PowerShellUtil {
    private PowerShellUtil() {}

    static Process start(String script) throws IOException {
        String safeScript = "$ErrorActionPreference='SilentlyContinue';[Console]::OutputEncoding=[Text.Encoding]::UTF8;" + script;
        String encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(safeScript.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_16LE));
        ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(
                "powershell.exe", "-NoProfile", "-NonInteractive", "-WindowStyle", "Hidden",
                "-EncodedCommand", encoded);
        // Probe output is machine-readable. Never mix PowerShell diagnostics into it.
        pb.redirectError(ProcessBuilder.Redirect.DISCARD);
        return pb.start();
    }
}
```

Base64 UTF-16LE + `-EncodedCommand`: no quoting can corrupt a probe. stderr is
DISCARDED so error text cannot pollute machine-readable output.

### 7) watchdog/ProcessScanner.java — visible windows

```java
package com.cheatguard.watchdog;

import com.cheatguard.core.AppLog;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

/**
 * Returns top-level visible Windows applications with PID, executable name and
 * window title.
 *
 * <p>Robustness rules baked in (learned the hard way in earlier builds):
 * the script is sent encoded so no shell quoting can corrupt it, output is read
 * as UTF-8 so window titles with special characters survive, the probe can never
 * hang longer than its timeout, and the child process is always destroyed so a
 * stuck PowerShell cannot leak on every watchdog cycle. On non-Windows systems
 * the scan returns an empty list instead of failing.
 */
public class ProcessScanner {

    private static final String FIELD_SEPARATOR = "@@@";
    private static final long COMMAND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 8;

    public List<ProcessInfo> getRunningProcesses() {
        List<ProcessInfo> out = new ArrayList<>();
        if (!isWindows()) return out;
        try {
            // $p.Path is the executable location; the watchdog uses it to tell the
            // student's own compiled work (built into the exam folder) from foreign apps.
            String command =
                    "Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.MainWindowTitle -ne '' } | " +
                    "ForEach-Object { '{0}" + FIELD_SEPARATOR + "{1}" + FIELD_SEPARATOR + "{2}"
                            + FIELD_SEPARATOR + "{3}' -f " +
                            "$_.Id, $_.ProcessName, $_.MainWindowTitle, $_.Path }";
            Process process = PowerShellUtil.start(command);
            try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
                    new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8))) {
                String line;
                while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                    String[] parts = line.trim().split(FIELD_SEPARATOR, 4);
                    if (parts.length < 2) continue;
                    try {
                        long pid = Long.parseLong(parts[0].trim());
                        String name = parts[1].trim();
                        if (!name.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT).endsWith(".exe")) name += ".exe";
                        String title = parts.length >= 3 ? parts[2].trim() : "";
                        String path = parts.length >= 4 ? parts[3].trim() : "";
                        out.add(new ProcessInfo(pid, name, title, "", path));
                    } catch (NumberFormatException ignored) {
                        // a garbled line must never abort the whole scan
                    }
                }
            }
            if (!process.waitFor(COMMAND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                process.destroyForcibly();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            AppLog.warn("Process scan error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
        return out;
    }

    private static boolean isWindows() {
        return System.getProperty("os.name", "").toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT).contains("win");
    }
}
```

`Get-Process | Where MainWindowTitle -ne ''` → `Id@@@Name@@@Title@@@Path`.
`split("@@@", 4)` with limit 4 so a path containing the separator cannot break
it. 8-second timeout then `destroyForcibly()`.

### 8) watchdog/ProcessInfo.java — pure data

```java
package com.cheatguard.watchdog;

public class ProcessInfo {
    private final long pid;
    private final String name;
    private final String windowTitle;
    private final String browserUrl;
    private final String imagePath;

    public ProcessInfo(long pid, String name, String windowTitle) {
        this(pid, name, windowTitle, "", "");
    }

    public ProcessInfo(long pid, String name, String windowTitle, String browserUrl) {
        this(pid, name, windowTitle, browserUrl, "");
    }

    public ProcessInfo(long pid, String name, String windowTitle, String browserUrl, String imagePath) {
        this.pid = pid;
        this.name = name == null ? "" : name;
        this.windowTitle = windowTitle == null ? "" : windowTitle;
        this.browserUrl = browserUrl == null ? "" : browserUrl;
        this.imagePath = imagePath == null ? "" : imagePath;
    }
    public long getPid() { return pid; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public String getWindowTitle() { return windowTitle; }
    public String getBrowserUrl() { return browserUrl; }
    /** Full executable path when the scanner could read one, else empty. */
    public String getImagePath() { return imagePath; }
}
```

Five final fields, three overloaded constructors chaining with `this(...)`.
The 5-field version carries the exe PATH, which the watchdog uses for the
exam-folder rule.

### 9) watchdog/ProcessWhitelist.java — the name-decision brain

```java

`taskkill /PID n /T /F` — `/T` also kills children, `/F` forces. The exit code
decides grey OK vs red ALERT.

Win32 `GetForegroundWindow` → PID → UI Automation finds an **Edit** control
named address/location → `ValuePattern` reads the URL.
`isAllowedBrowserPage` checks the URL; fallback: the window title contains the
site or its brand (min 3 letters).

Clipboard cleared twice (Java Toolkit + native `Set-Clipboard`/WinForms). The
Win+V history: WinRT `ClearHistory()` first; fallback toggles the registry
value off for 400 ms (Windows drops stored entries) and restores the user's
original setting. `restore()` is the end-of-exam safety net. `prepare()` ALSO
wipes the Windows recent-items lists (Start menu recents, jump lists,
Open-dialog recents) — they are only auto-generated shortcuts, and they are
exactly how a pre-exam file would be reopened inside an allowed app in one
click. The files themselves are untouched.

`resolve()`: stored path → `where` on PATH → shallow search (depth 3) in
Program Files / LOCALAPPDATA. Folder-aware editors get the exam folder as an
argument; EVERYTHING gets it as the working directory, so open/save dialogs
start in the exam folder.

## B4. OOP concepts in my part (with the real places)

1. **Interface (abstraction)** — `ViolationListener`: one method; the engine
   calls it without knowing the GUI. Main implements it as a LAMBDA — runtime
   polymorphism.
2. **Implementing interfaces** — `WatchdogEngine implements Runnable` (own
   thread), `DnsAllowlistServer implements Closeable` (try-with-resources).
3. **Encapsulation** — the 60-second grace window is a private final field;
   `ProcessWhitelist`'s sets are private; outsiders only ask `isAllowed(...)`.
4. **Composition** — `WatchdogEngine` HAS a scanner, whitelist, closer, folder
   monitor and device monitor; each small class does one job.
5. **Constructor overloading** — `DnsAllowlistServer` and `ProcessInfo` have
   multiple constructors chaining with `this(...)`.
6. **Package-private design** — `PowerShellUtil` and `WebsiteViolationReporter`
   are package-private classes: usable inside the watchdog package, invisible
   outside.

## B5. Technologies in my part

Raw UDP sockets + DNS wire format parsed by hand · `ExecutorService` pool
(8 workers) · `ConcurrentHashMap` cache · connected-socket anti-spoofing ·
scheduled file flushing · PowerShell `-EncodedCommand` probes · elevated
helper with a file-marker protocol · `Set-DnsClientServerAddress`,
`New-NetFirewallRule`, `Get-NetAdapter`/`Get-NetRoute`, registry policies,
`icacls`/`takeown` · UI Automation (browser URL) · Shell.Application COM
(Explorer windows) · CIM/WMI queries (devices) · `ProcessHandle.allProcesses()`
with PID+start-time identity · `taskkill /T /F`.

## B6. Questions Sir may ask me

**Q: How exactly do you block a website?**
A: The computer asks our local DNS server for the address. Not allowed → we
answer "does not exist". No address, no connection — in any program.

**Q: What if the student changes DNS settings?**
A: They cannot — that needs admin. And the helper re-points every adapter every
half second, including adapters that appear mid-exam.

**Q: What about a VPN?**
A: Three layers: VPN programs are closed wherever they are installed, their
ports are firewalled, and the firewall only lets web traffic reach approved
site addresses anyway.

**Q: Raw IP address typed directly?**
A: Default-deny outbound: only addresses that approved sites actually resolved
to may connect. A raw IP not on that live list is refused.

**Q: Why your own DNS server, not the hosts file?**
A: The hosts file cannot do subdomains cleanly, cannot log, cannot cache, and
cannot feed a firewall. Our resolver gives allowlist logic with subdomains,
logging, caching, and it covers every program.

**Q: How do you know a DNS reply is real and not fake?**
A: The socket is CONNECTED to the upstream (the OS drops datagrams from anyone
else), and we accept a reply only if its transaction ID, question name and
question type match what we asked.

**Q: Thread safety in the DNS server?**
A: The log manager is synchronized, the cache is a ConcurrentHashMap, the IP
set is a synchronized set, control flags are volatile, and the UI is only
touched through `SwingUtilities.invokeLater`.

**Q: What if your app or the PC dies?**
A: Normal programs cannot kill an elevated app (UIPI). If the PC dies, the
leftover state stays on disk; the next app start detects it and restores the
network automatically.

**Q: Why kill programs instead of just logging them?**
A: Watching is evidence, closing is prevention. A headless browser in the
background is a full cheat toolkit; if we only logged it, the cheating would
already be happening. We do both: close AND log.

**Handover:** "That is the engine room. Now my teammate shows what the
invigilator sees, how we built the one-file installer, and how we tested it all."

# PART C — MEMBER 3: UI, Installer & Testing
*(Main.java + the gui package + the build + the 76 checks)*

## C1. What I say (about 3 minutes)

"My part is the interface, the installer and the testing.

The interface is Java Swing with six screens: first-run password, home, session
setup, live monitor, settings, and dashboard. We switch with CardLayout — all
screens sit in one frame like a deck of cards. We did not like the default grey
Java look, so we paint our own theme: in UITheme we override `paintComponent`
and draw rounded buttons, cards and input boxes with Java2D. The password field
has an eye icon drawn with pure Java2D — click to show or hide the password.

A big lesson was responsiveness: sealing the log and starting the lockdown take
many seconds. On the UI thread Windows would show 'Not Responding'. So every
slow job runs on a worker thread and the screen is updated only through
`SwingUtilities.invokeLater`.

The installer: one script compiles the code, packs a jar, then `jpackage` with
WiX produces ONE setup exe with its own trimmed Java runtime. The testing: our
own automatic suite with 76 checks in 15 groups — all pass. My teammate will
take questions on my part too if I miss anything."

- The five `activeXxx` fields hold the current session's objects; they are set
  at start and cleared at end.
- `sessionBusy` is `volatile` — the UI thread and worker threads both read it;
  it stops double-clicks from running two flows.

### Chunk 2 — main(): the seven startup steps

```java

        // process to another account (invigilator's admin credentials over the

        // desktop, not the administrator's.
        for (int i = 0; i < args.length - 1; i++) {
            if ("-interactiveProfile".equals(args[i])) {

            INSTANCE_GUARD.close();
            return;

    // ------------------------------------------------------------- elevation

    /**
     * Relaunch as administrator when not already elevated and report whether the
     * caller should continue in this process.
     *
     * <p>Elevation is the backbone of the whole lockdown: a high-integrity process

     * processes (Windows UIPI blocks it outright), the lockdown state under
     * ProgramData is only writable by Administrators, and the elevated helper script
     * can be staged where it cannot be swapped while its UAC prompt waits. A packaged
     * build that could not elevate (prompt declined) shows why and exits.
     */
```

1. Read the real user's profile/Desktop from the arguments (captured before
   elevation).
2. `ensureElevated()` — become admin or exit.
3. Install crash handlers (packaged builds have no console).
4. Dark look-and-feel.
5. Single-instance check — a second copy refuses to start.
6. Repair any leftover lockdown from a crashed session.
7. Build the window ON the EDT (`SwingUtilities.invokeLater`).

### Chunk 3 — becoming administrator

```java
    private static boolean ensureElevated() {
        if (!isWindows()) return true;
        if (isElevated()) return true;

        String launcher = System.getProperty("jpackage.app-path", "");

                argList.append(",'-interactiveDesktop','")
                       .append(desktopNow.getAbsolutePath().replace("'", "''")).append('\'');
            }
        } catch (Exception ignored) {
        }
        String command = "$p=Start-Process -FilePath '" + exe.getAbsolutePath().replace("'", "''")
                + "'" + argList + " -Verb RunAs -PassThru; if($null -eq $p){ exit 1 }";

    }

    private static boolean isWindows() {
        return System.getProperty("os.name", "").toLowerCase(java.util.Locale.ROOT).contains("win");
    }

```

- Already elevated or not Windows → continue. Dev runs (`java -jar`) continue
  unelevated with a console warning.
- Otherwise: PowerShell `Start-Process -Verb RunAs` with our own exe (plus the
  captured user folders as arguments). Approved → a NEW elevated copy runs and
  this one exits. Declined → an explanation dialog.

### Chunk 4 — `start()`: building the window

```java
    private void start() {
        frame = new JFrame("Cheat.Guard");
        frame.setSize(1120, 720);
        frame.setMinimumSize(new Dimension(960, 640));
        frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.DO_NOTHING_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
            @Override public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e) { attemptApplicationExit(); }
        });
        if (SystemTray.isSupported()) {
            setupTrayIcon();
            frame.addWindowStateListener(new WindowAdapter() {
                @Override public void windowStateChanged(WindowEvent e) {
                    if ((e.getNewState() & Frame.ICONIFIED) != 0) hideToTray();
                }
            });
        }
        UITheme.applyIcon(frame);

        cardLayout = new CardLayout();
        cardContainer = new JPanel(cardLayout);
        cardContainer.setBackground(UITheme.BG_DARK);
        frame.setContentPane(cardContainer);

        if (adminAuth.isTampered()) {
            JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame,
                    "The stored administrator credential does not belong to this computer and was rejected.\n"
                            + "Set a new administrator password to continue.",
                    "Credential rejected", JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE);
            adminAuth.discardRejectedCredential();
        }
        if (!adminAuth.isConfigured()) {
            replaceCard(CARD_FIRST_RUN, buildFirstRunCard());
            showCard(CARD_FIRST_RUN);
        } else {
            replaceCard(CARD_HOME, buildHomeCard());
            showCard(CARD_HOME);
        }
        frame.setVisible(true);
        Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
            com.cheatguard.config.AppPaths.migrateLegacyProfileData();
            maybeCreateDesktopShortcut();
        }, "CheatGuard-FirstRun");
        t.setDaemon(true);
        t.start();
    }

    // ------------------------------------------------------- first-run set-up

    /** Shown only on a fresh installation: there is no default password to fall back on. */
```

- Close (X) is intercepted — it asks for the password first.
- Tray support: minimizing hides to the tray.
- Tampered credential file → warn + discard. Not configured → first-run
  screen; else home. A background thread migrates old data and creates the
  desktop shortcut once.

### Chunk 5 — the first-run password screen

```java
    private JPanel buildFirstRunCard() {
        JPanel card = UITheme.card();
        card.setLayout(new BoxLayout(card, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS));
        card.setBorder(UITheme.padding(34, 40, 34, 40));

        JPasswordField first = UITheme.password();
        JPasswordField second = UITheme.password();
        first.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(400, 42));
        second.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(400, 42));

        JLabel error = UITheme.muted(" ");
        error.setForeground(UITheme.ACCENT_RED);
        JButton save = UITheme.primary("Create password and continue");
        save.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(400, 46));

        Runnable doSave = () -> save.doClick();
        first.addActionListener(e -> doSave.run());
        second.addActionListener(e -> doSave.run());
        save.addActionListener(e -> {
            char[] a = first.getPassword();
            char[] b = second.getPassword();
            try {
                if (a.length == 0) {
                    error.setText("Choose a password first.");
                    return;
                }
                if (!Arrays.equals(a, b)) {
                    error.setText("The two passwords do not match.");
                    return;
                }
                adminAuth.createPassword(a);
                replaceCard(CARD_HOME, buildHomeCard());
                showCard(CARD_HOME);
            } catch (IllegalArgumentException weak) {
                error.setText(weak.getMessage());
            } catch (Exception ex) {
                error.setText("Could not save the password: " + ex.getMessage());
            } finally {
                Arrays.fill(a, '\0');
                Arrays.fill(b, '\0');
                first.setText("");
                second.setText("");
            }
        });

        card.add(brandMark(300));
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(20));
        card.add(UITheme.title("Set the administrator password"));
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(8));
        card.add(UITheme.muted("This password protects settings, the session dashboard and sealed logs."));
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(4));
        card.add(UITheme.muted("At least " + AdminAuth.MIN_LENGTH
                + " characters, mixing letters with a number or symbol. It is never stored as text."));
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(22));
        card.add(labelled("New password", first));
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(14));
        card.add(labelled("Repeat password", second));
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(22));
        card.add(save);
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(10));
        card.add(error);
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(first::requestFocusInWindow);
        return centered(card);
    }

    // -------------------------------------------------------------- home card

```

- Two password fields (with eye toggles) + error label + save button.
- Save: empty → error; mismatch → error; weak → the store's message shows.
  Success → home screen. `finally` wipes both char arrays.

### Chunk 6 — the home screen

```java
    private JPanel buildHomeCard() {
        JPanel card = UITheme.card();
        card.setLayout(new BoxLayout(card, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS));
        card.setBorder(UITheme.padding(38, 54, 38, 54));

        JButton startBtn = UITheme.primary("Start exam session");
        JButton dashboardBtn = UITheme.secondary("Session dashboard");
        JButton settingsBtn = UITheme.secondary("Allowed apps and websites");
        JButton exitBtn = UITheme.ghost("Exit");

        Dimension wide = new Dimension(360, 48);
        for (JButton b : new JButton[]{startBtn, dashboardBtn, settingsBtn}) b.setMaximumSize(wide);
        exitBtn.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(360, 38));

        startBtn.addActionListener(e -> {
            if (sessionBusy) return;
            replaceCard(CARD_SETUP, buildSetupCard());
            showCard(CARD_SETUP);
        });
        dashboardBtn.addActionListener(e -> openDashboard());
        settingsBtn.addActionListener(e -> openSettings());
        exitBtn.addActionListener(e -> attemptApplicationExit());

        card.add(brandMark(360));
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(14));
        card.add(UITheme.muted("Exam lockdown for Windows — website allowlist, app control and sealed audit logs"));
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(30));
        card.add(startBtn);
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(11));
        card.add(dashboardBtn);
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(11));
        card.add(settingsBtn);
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(20));
        card.add(exitBtn);
        return centered(card);
    }

    // ------------------------------------------------------------- setup card

```

Four buttons; dashboard and settings first verify the admin password.

### Chunk 7 — the setup screen

```java
    private JPanel buildSetupCard() {
        JPanel card = UITheme.card();
        card.setLayout(new BoxLayout(card, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS));
        card.setBorder(UITheme.padding(34, 44, 34, 44));

        JTextField courseField = UITheme.field("e.g. CSE-3202");
        JTextField studentField = UITheme.field("e.g. 2021831045");
        courseField.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(400, 42));
        studentField.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(400, 42));

        JButton startBtn = UITheme.primary("Start monitoring");
        JButton backBtn = UITheme.ghost("Back");
        startBtn.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(400, 46));
        backBtn.setMaximumSize(new Dimension(400, 38));

        Runnable doStart = () -> {
            String course = courseField.getText().trim();
            String student = studentField.getText().trim();
            if (course.isEmpty() || student.isEmpty()) {
                JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, "Enter both the course code and the student ID.",
                        "Missing details", JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE);
                return;
            }
            if (AppConfig.getInstance().getAllowedSites().isEmpty()) {
                int choice = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(frame,
                        "No approved website has been configured.\n"
                                + "During the session EVERY website will fail to open,\n"
                                + "including the exam platform itself.\n\n"
                                + "Start the session anyway?",
                        "No approved websites", JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION, JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE);
                if (choice != JOptionPane.YES_OPTION) return;
            }
            startExam(course, student);
        };
        startBtn.addActionListener(e -> doStart.run());
        backBtn.addActionListener(e -> showCard(CARD_HOME));
        courseField.addActionListener(e -> doStart.run());
        studentField.addActionListener(e -> doStart.run());

        card.add(UITheme.title("New exam session"));
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(8));
        card.add(UITheme.muted("A Desktop folder named Exam_<StudentID> is created for the student's work."));
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(4));
        card.add(UITheme.muted("Browsers are closed when the session starts, so ask the student to save first."));
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(24));
        card.add(labelled("Course code", courseField));

        card.add(startBtn);
        card.add(Box.createVerticalStrut(10));
        card.add(backBtn);
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(courseField::requestFocusInWindow);
        return centered(card);
    }

    // ------------------------------------------------------- session lifecycle

```

- Both fields required; an empty allowlist triggers a YES/NO warning ("EVERY
  website will fail"); Enter in either field clicks Start.

### Chunk 8 — `startExam()`: the most important method

```java

    private void startExam(String course, String studentId) {
        if (sessionBusy) return;
        sessionBusy = true;

        // Session record and log protection are quick and local; they happen here so
        // the monitor screen exists the moment the slow, elevated steps begin.
        activeSession = new ExamSession(course, studentId);
        activeSecurityVault = new SecurityVault(adminAuth);
        activeSecurityVault.beginProtection(activeSession.getSessionFile());

        JTextPane liveLog = createLogPane();
        for (Violation v : activeSession.getLogManager().getAllViolations()) appendViolation(liveLog, v);

     */
```

Read the order — it is the lesson:
1. Session + log created immediately (fast, local); the log file is locked.
2. The monitor screen shows "Starting session…" right away.
3. The slow elevated work (clipboard, lockdown — up to 90 s) runs on a WORKER
   thread; the UI never freezes.
4. Success → protect the log file, start the watchdog thread, rebuild the
   screen as active. Failure → explain, go home, clear everything so nothing
   is half-started.

### Chunk 9 — the account-count row and the failure dialog

                Violation.Severity.INFO);
        session.getLogManager().record(v);
        listener.onViolation(v);
    }

    private int countLocalUsers() {

        } catch (Exception e) {
            return 1;
        }
    }

                ? "Windows did not report a reason."
                : detail;
        JTextArea area = new JTextArea(
                "The website lock could not be enabled, so the exam was NOT started.\n"
                        + "Nothing on this computer was left changed.\n\nWindows reported:\n" + text);
        area.setEditable(false);
        area.setLineWrap(true);

    }

    // ----------------------------------------------------------- monitor card

```

- `countLocalUsers()` runs a PowerShell count; more than one account → an info
  row for the invigilator (fast user switching is already hidden by the
  helper).

  end-session button (in a GridBagLayout wrapper so it does not stretch).

```

- Password → verify → worker thread → `finishActiveExam(password)`.
- `finishActiveExam`: stop the watchdog (interrupt + join), write SESSION_END,
  SEAL the vault, harden the sealed files, and in `finally` ALWAYS restore the
  network + clipboard — even on failure the student gets the internet back and
  the app stays open for a retry.

### Chunk 12 — the guarded exit

```java
    private void attemptApplicationExit() {
        // A fresh installation has no password yet; asking for one here would trap
        // the invigilator in an app that can never be closed. Nothing is at risk:

    // -------------------------------------------------------------- tray icon

    /** Minimize-to-tray so the window can be hidden during a session without closing it. */
```

- Fresh install (no password) → exit directly, else password. Active session →
  seal first; sealing failed → stay open for retry.

### Chunk 13 — the tray

```java
    private void setupTrayIcon() {
        try {
            ImageIcon icon = UITheme.image("/icon.png", 16, 0);
            if (icon == null) return;

            menu.add(show);
            trayIcon = new TrayIcon(icon.getImage(), "Cheat.Guard", menu);
            trayIcon.setImageAutoSize(true);
            trayIcon.addActionListener(e -> restoreFromTray());
            SystemTray.getSystemTray().add(trayIcon);
        } catch (Exception ignored) {
            trayIcon = null; // tray unavailable: normal minimizing keeps working
        }

                    TrayIcon.MessageType.INFO);
        }
    }

    private void restoreFromTray() {
        frame.setVisible(true);
        frame.setExtendedState(Frame.NORMAL);
        frame.toFront();
    }

    // -------------------------------------------------- admin-guarded screens

```

- `SystemTray` + `TrayIcon` with a "Show Cheat.Guard" menu; minimizing hides
  the window; clicking the icon restores it. One balloon hint, ever.

### Chunk 14 — the password-guarded screens

```java
    private void openDashboard() {
        // ONE password check at the door: the dashboard keeps the verified password
        // in memory, so opening and deleting sessions never asks again.
        char[] password = promptAdminPassword("Open session dashboard");
        if (password == null) return;
        AdminCredentialStore.Result r = adminAuth.check(password.clone());
        if (!r.success()) {
            explainVerificationFailure(r);
            return;
        }
        replaceCard(CARD_DASHBOARD, new DashboardPanel(adminAuth, password, () -> showCard(CARD_HOME)));
        showCard(CARD_DASHBOARD);
    }

    private void openSettings() {
        char[] password = promptAdminPassword("Open allowlist settings");
        if (password == null) return;
        if (verifyOrExplain(password)) {
            replaceCard(CARD_SETTINGS, new SettingsPanel(adminAuth, () -> showCard(CARD_HOME)));
            showCard(CARD_SETTINGS);
        }
    }

        pf.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(260, 36));
        JPanel content = UITheme.column(8, leftAlign(UITheme.muted("Administrator password")), pf);
        content.setBorder(UITheme.padding(4, 4, 4, 4));
        int result = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(frame, content, title,
                JOptionPane.OK_CANCEL_OPTION, JOptionPane.PLAIN_MESSAGE);
        return result == JOptionPane.OK_OPTION ? pf.getPassword() : null;
    }

    /** Verify a password and explain a refusal, including throttling. */
    private boolean verifyOrExplain(char[] password) {
        AdminCredentialStore.Result r = adminAuth.check(password);
        if (r.success()) return true;
        explainVerificationFailure(r);
        return false;
    }

    private void explainVerificationFailure(AdminCredentialStore.Result r) {
        String message;
        if (!r.configured()) {
            message = "No administrator password is set on this computer.";
        } else if (r.lockedForMs() > 0) {
            long seconds = Math.max(1, r.lockedForMs() / 1000);
            message = "Too many incorrect attempts. Try again in " + seconds + " seconds.";
        } else {
            message = r.attemptsLeft() >= AdminCredentialStore.MAX_ATTEMPTS
                    ? "Enter the administrator password."
                    : "Incorrect password. " + r.attemptsLeft() + " attempt(s) left before a lockout.";
        }
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, message, "Access denied", JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE);
    }

    // ------------------------------------------------------------- shortcuts

    /**
     * Create the desktop shortcut once, on the first run after installation. The
     * MSI places a Start Menu entry; invigilators expect the icon on the Desktop
     * too. Best effort only — a failure here must never block the app.
     */
```

- `openDashboard()` / `openSettings()` — both go through the same prompt.
- `promptAdminPassword()` builds a dialog with one `UITheme.password()` field
  (so it has the eye toggle).
- `explainVerificationFailure()` shows: not configured / locked for N seconds /
  N attempts left — straight from the credential store's result.

### Chunk 15 — the one-time shortcut, and the small helpers

- `maybeCreateDesktopShortcut()`: once ever (a marker file remembers); creates
  `Cheat.Guard.lnk` through PowerShell's WScript.Shell COM object.
- `appendViolation()`: picks a style by severity (red bold / yellow / grey),
  trims the pane past ~60,000 characters (the FILE keeps everything), inserts
  the row, auto-scrolls.
- `replaceCard()`/`showCard()`: the CardLayout helpers.
- `createLogPane()`: the dark monospace text pane used for the live log.

        }

    // ----------------------------------------------------------------- labels

```

- ~20 `UIManager.put` keys darken tooltips, dialogs, scrollbars, combos.
- `image()` loads a classpath bitmap and scales it smoothly (height auto from
  aspect ratio when 0).

### Chunk 3 — label factories

```java
    public static JLabel display(String text) {
        return label(text, FONT_DISPLAY, TEXT_WHITE);
    }

    public static JLabel title(String text) {
        return label(text, FONT_TITLE, TEXT_WHITE);
    }

    public static JLabel section(String text) {
        JLabel l = label(text.toUpperCase(), FONT_SECTION, TEXT_DIM);
        return l;
    }

    public static JLabel body(String text) {
        return label(text, FONT_BODY, TEXT_WHITE);
    }

    public static JLabel muted(String text) {
        return label(text, FONT_SMALL, TEXT_MUTED);
    }

    private static JLabel label(String text, Font font, Color colour) {
        JLabel l = new JLabel(text);
        l.setFont(font);
        l.setForeground(colour);
        l.setAlignmentX(Component.CENTER_ALIGNMENT);
        return l;
    }

    // ---------------------------------------------------------------- buttons

```

Five factory methods (display/title/section/body/muted) — one place controls
every label in the app.

### Chunk 4 — the button factories (polymorphism showcase)

```java
    public static JButton primary(String text) {
        return button(text, ACCENT_RED, ACCENT_RED_DARK, ACCENT_RED_PRESS, Color.WHITE, false);
    }

    public static JButton secondary(String text) {
        return button(text, BG_ELEVATED, BG_ELEVATED_HOVER, BG_ELEVATED_PRESS, TEXT_WHITE, true);
    }

    public static JButton ghost(String text) {
        JButton b = button(text, BG_PANEL, BG_ELEVATED, BG_PANEL_PRESS, TEXT_MUTED, true);
        b.setFont(FONT_SMALL);
        return b;
    }

    /** Rounded, flat button with hover and press states and no focus painting. */
    private static JButton button(String text, Color base, Color hover, Color press, Color fg,
                                  boolean outlined) {
        JButton b = new JButton(text) {
            @Override
            protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
                Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g.create();
                g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);
                Color fill = !isEnabled() ? BG_ELEVATED
                        : getModel().isPressed() ? press
                        : getModel().isRollover() ? hover
                        : base;
                g2.setColor(fill);
                g2.fillRoundRect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight(), 12, 12);
                if (outlined) {
                    g2.setColor(BORDER);
                    g2.drawRoundRect(0, 0, getWidth() - 1, getHeight() - 1, 12, 12);
                }
                g2.dispose();
                super.paintComponent(g);
            }
        };
        b.setRolloverEnabled(true);
        b.setFont(FONT_BODY);
        b.setForeground(fg);
        b.setContentAreaFilled(false);
        b.setBorderPainted(false);
        b.setFocusPainted(false);
        b.setOpaque(false);
        b.setCursor(new Cursor(Cursor.HAND_CURSOR));
        b.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(11, 20, 11, 20));
        b.setAlignmentX(Component.CENTER_ALIGNMENT);
        return b;
    }

    // ----------------------------------------------------------------- inputs

```

- An anonymous subclass of `JButton` overrides `paintComponent`: antialiasing,
  the fill picked from the button MODEL (normal / hover / press), a 12-px
  rounded rectangle, then `super.paintComponent` draws the text on top.
- `primary` (red), `secondary` (elevated + border), `ghost` (transparent,
  small font). Hover/press come from the model, so keyboard activation works.

### Chunk 5 — the text field and the password field with the eye

```java
    public static JTextField field(String placeholder) {
        JTextField f = new JTextField();
        styleInput(f);
        if (placeholder != null && !placeholder.isEmpty()) f.setToolTipText(placeholder);
        return f;
    }

    /**
     * Masked input with an embedded eye toggle: clicking the eye reveals the text and
     * clicking again masks it, so a mistyped password can be checked without ever
     * leaving the field. The toggle lives in the field's right margin, so the text
     * never runs underneath it.
     */
    public static JPasswordField password() {
        JPasswordField f = new JPasswordField();
        f.setEchoChar(ECHO);
        styleInput(f);
        JToggleButton eye = eyeToggle(f);
        f.setMargin(new Insets(0, 0, 0, 46));
        f.setLayout(new BorderLayout(0, 0));
        f.add(eye, BorderLayout.EAST);
        return f;
    }

    private static JToggleButton eyeToggle(JPasswordField field) {
        JToggleButton eye = new JToggleButton() {
            @Override
            protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
                Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g.create();
                g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);
                g2.setColor(getModel().isRollover() || isSelected() ? TEXT_WHITE : TEXT_MUTED);
                g2.setStroke(new BasicStroke(1.4f, BasicStroke.CAP_ROUND, BasicStroke.JOIN_ROUND));
                int cx = getWidth() / 2;
                int cy = getHeight() / 2;
                // Almond eye: two curved lids meeting at the corners - a plain oval
                // read as the "all-seeing eye", so the lids are drawn as curves.
                Path2D almond = new Path2D.Double();
                almond.moveTo(cx - 9, cy);
                almond.quadTo(cx - 2, cy - 7, cx + 9, cy);
                almond.quadTo(cx - 2, cy + 7, cx - 9, cy);
                almond.closePath();
                g2.draw(almond);
                if (isSelected()) {
                    // Text is visible: eye ON - open eye with a small pupil.
                    g2.fillOval(cx - 2, cy - 2, 4, 4);
                } else {
                    // Text is hidden: eye OFF - closed eye with the classic slash.
                    g2.drawLine(cx + 8, cy - 7, cx - 8, cy + 7);
                }
                g2.dispose();
            }
        };
        eye.setToolTipText("Show password");
        eye.setFocusable(false);
        eye.setRolloverEnabled(true);
        eye.setBorderPainted(false);
        eye.setContentAreaFilled(false);
        eye.setOpaque(false);
        eye.setCursor(new Cursor(Cursor.HAND_CURSOR));
        eye.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(36, 24));
        eye.addActionListener(e -> {
            boolean show = eye.isSelected();
            field.setEchoChar(show ? (char) 0 : ECHO);
            eye.setToolTipText(show ? "Hide password" : "Show password");
        });
        return eye;
    }

```

- `password()`: echo `•`, margin `0,0,0,46` reserves the eye strip INSIDE the
  text area (text can never run under the icon), and a `JToggleButton` child
  at `BorderLayout.EAST`.
- `eyeToggle` PAINTS the icon: an oval outline, a filled pupil, and a diagonal
  slash when the text is visible. Clicking flips `setEchoChar` between `•` and
  `(char) 0` and updates the tooltip. `setFocusable(false)` — it never steals
  Tab focus.

### Chunk 6 — input styling and our own rounded border

```java
    private static void styleInput(JTextField f) {
        f.setFont(FONT_BODY);
        f.setBackground(BG_INPUT);
        f.setForeground(TEXT_WHITE);
        f.setCaretColor(ACCENT_TEAL);
        f.setSelectionColor(new Color(46, 196, 160, 70));
        f.setSelectedTextColor(TEXT_WHITE);
        Border resting = inputBorder(BORDER);
        Border focused = inputBorder(FOCUS_RING);
        f.setBorder(resting);
        f.addFocusListener(new FocusAdapter() {
            @Override public void focusGained(FocusEvent e) { f.setBorder(focused); }
            @Override public void focusLost(FocusEvent e) { f.setBorder(resting); }
        });
    }

    private static Border inputBorder(Color colour) {
        return BorderFactory.createCompoundBorder(
                roundedLine(colour, 10),
                BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(9, 12, 9, 12));
    }

    /** One-pixel outline with a real radius; LineBorder's rounded arc is far too tight. */
    private static Border roundedLine(Color colour, int radius) {
        return new AbstractBorder() {
            @Override
            public void paintBorder(Component c, Graphics g, int x, int y, int w, int h) {
                Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g.create();
                g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);
                g2.setColor(colour);
                g2.drawRoundRect(x, y, w - 1, h - 1, radius, radius);
                g2.dispose();
            }

            @Override
            public Insets getBorderInsets(Component c, Insets insets) {
                insets.set(1, 1, 1, 1);
                return insets;
            }

            @Override
            public boolean isBorderOpaque() {
                return false;
            }
        };
    }

    // ------------------------------------------------------ panels and layout

    /** Rounded surface used for every grouped block of content. */
```

- A `FocusAdapter` swaps the border colour to a teal ring on focus.
- `roundedLine` extends `AbstractBorder` and draws a 1-px rounded rectangle —
  Swing's rounded LineBorder has an arc of only ~2 px, too tight for our look.

### Chunk 7 — cards and pills

```java
    public static JPanel card() {
        return card(BG_PANEL, true);
    }

    public static JPanel card(Color fill, boolean outlined) {
        JPanel p = new JPanel() {
            @Override
            protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
                Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g.create();
                g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);
                g2.setColor(fill);
                g2.fillRoundRect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight(), 16, 16);
                if (outlined) {
                    g2.setColor(BORDER);
                    g2.drawRoundRect(0, 0, getWidth() - 1, getHeight() - 1, 16, 16);
                }
                g2.dispose();
            }
        };
        p.setOpaque(false);
        p.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(18, 18, 18, 18));
        return p;
    }

    /** Small coloured status pill, e.g. "PROTECTED" or "3 ALERTS". */
    public static JLabel pill(String text, Color colour) {
        JLabel l = new JLabel(text) {
            @Override
            protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
                Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g.create();
                g2.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);
                g2.setColor(new Color(colour.getRed(), colour.getGreen(), colour.getBlue(), 38));
                g2.fillRoundRect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight(), getHeight(), getHeight());
                g2.setColor(new Color(colour.getRed(), colour.getGreen(), colour.getBlue(), 120));
                g2.drawRoundRect(0, 0, getWidth() - 1, getHeight() - 1, getHeight(), getHeight());
                g2.dispose();
                super.paintComponent(g);
            }
        };
        l.setFont(FONT_SMALL);
        l.setForeground(colour);
        l.setOpaque(false);
        l.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(5, 12, 5, 12));
        return l;
    }

```

- `card()` paints a 16-px rounded panel with an outline; `pill()` paints the
  translucent rounded status labels (ALERTS / BLOCKED).

### Chunk 8 — layout helpers and the backdrop

```java
    public static JPanel row(int gap, Component... children) {
        JPanel p = new JPanel(new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.LEFT, gap, 0));
        p.setOpaque(false);

                        new Color[]{new Color(244, 52, 43, 20), new Color(244, 52, 43, 0)}));

- `row`/`column`/`grow` are tiny layout helpers used by every screen.
- `backdrop()` paints a vertical gradient plus a faint red radial glow —
  single-card screens do not look like a flat black box.
- `scroll()` — dark scroll pane with a rounded border and a painted dark
  corner; `combo()` — dark drop-down renderer; `styleList()` — consistent
  list colours.

**What to notice:**
- `format(Violation)` → `row(time, statusOf(severity), message(...))`.
  `statusOf`: WARNING/CRITICAL → "ALERT", NOTICE → "WARN", else "OK". The row
  is `String.format("%s   %-5s  %s", ...)` — time, a 5-character status, one
  sentence trimmed to 90 characters.
- `formatRaw(line)` parses STORED lines (the dashboard uses it): it finds
  `[RED-FLAG]` / `[NOTICE]` for the status and splits ` :: ` and ` - ` to
  recover type and detail. Old logs from earlier versions still parse.
- `message()` is a switch of friendly sentences ("Closed before exam: X",
  "Allowed app had a file outside the exam folder open, closed: X",
  "Website blocked: X", "Opened outside exam folder: X" — only the LAST path
  part shows). `clean()` strips legacy prefixes; `lastPathPart` shortens
  paths; `readableType` is the fallback.

**What to notice:**
- `extends JPanel` — inheritance; the body is a `GridLayout(1, 3)` of three
  cards: applications, websites, password.
- The apps card: `JList` + input + Add (Enter works) + "Choose .exe"
  (`JFileChooser` → `addAllowedProcessPath`, which also stores the full path
  so the app can be launched on the exam folder) + Remove selected.
- The websites card is the same minus browse; an invalid domain shows a dialog
  (because `normalizeSite` returned empty).
- The password card: three password fields WITH eye toggles; Update calls
  `adminAuth.changePassword`; the status label turns teal/red; all three char
  arrays are wiped in `finally`.

**What to notice:**
- Left: the saved-session list (`JList` of files; `.dat` rows get an
  "[UNSEALED]" prefix) + Refresh + Delete selected.
- Right: password row + six stat tiles + the log viewer, inside a
  `JSplitPane` (30% left).
- `openSelected()` runs on a WORKER thread (PBKDF2 is slow) and comes back to
  the EDT; the password field is cleared after EVERY operation.
- `renderLogWithHighlights()` counts `[RED-FLAG]` and `[NOTICE]`, parses
  SESSION_START/END fields by string search, and appends rows in red / yellow /
  white. `deleteSelected()` confirms, then deletes through the vault (which
  may raise a UAC prompt — hence the worker thread).

**The five steps:**
1. Check tools (javac/jar/jpackage on PATH; WiX auto-detected from our tools
   folder or the standard installs).
2. Clean bin/build/dist and recreate.
3. `javac -encoding UTF-8 -d bin @sources.txt` — the @-file avoids command-line
   length limits.
4. `jar --create --main-class com.cheatguard.Main -C bin . -C resources .` —
   classes + resources in one jar; the support tools are copied in so they
   ship inside the installed folder.
5. `jpackage --type exe` with WiX: icon, shortcuts, upgrade UUID, and the
   trimmed runtime (`--add-modules ...` must be TOP LEVEL — a JDK quirk we
   learned; `--compress zip-6` keeps it small). Output renamed to
   `dist\CheatGuard-Setup.exe` (~40 MB).

## C9. OOP concepts in my part (with the real places)

1. **Inheritance** — `DashboardPanel extends JPanel`, `SettingsPanel extends
   JPanel`; our buttons extend `JButton`; our border extends `AbstractBorder`.
2. **Method overriding + polymorphism** — `paintComponent`: Swing calls the
   same method, OUR drawing runs. `toString()` overridden in Violation.
3. **Adapter pattern** — `WindowAdapter` (override only `windowClosing` +
   `windowStateChanged`), `FocusAdapter` (focus ring) — instead of five empty
   methods.
4. **Encapsulation** — `UITheme` is final with a private constructor; screens
   only call its factory methods, so the design lives in ONE place.
5. **Interface + lambda** — the violation listener in Main; `Runnable` for the
   worker threads.
6. **Generics** — `leftAlign(T component)` returns the same type it receives.

## C10. Technologies in my part

Swing (JFrame, CardLayout, BoxLayout, GridBagLayout, BorderLayout, JTextPane
with styled text) · Java2D custom painting with antialiasing · `javax.swing.
Timer` · SystemTray (AWT) · worker threads + `SwingUtilities.invokeLater` ·
jpackage + WiX · a self-written headless test framework.

## C11. Questions Sir may ask me

**Q: Why Swing, not JavaFX?**
A: Swing ships inside every JDK, so the single-installer plan stays simple. We
repaint everything ourselves, so the old Swing look is not visible anyway.

**Q: What is CardLayout?**
A: Many panels in one container, one visible at a time — like cards in hand.
Perfect for a wizard-style app; only one window is ever needed.

**Q: What happens if you do a long task on the UI thread?**
A: The window stops repainting and Windows says "Not Responding". Ours never
does: slow work runs on worker threads, results return via `invokeLater`.

**Q: What is `invokeLater` doing?**
A: Only one thread (the Event Dispatch Thread) may touch Swing. `invokeLater`
queues a small job onto it — the official safe bridge from worker threads.

**Q: How does the eye icon work?**
A: A small toggle button placed inside the password field, with the text area
shortened by a margin so text never runs under it. The icon is drawn with
Java2D; clicking flips the echo character between a dot and nothing.

**Q: How did you make one installer?**
A: One script: compile → jar → `jpackage` with WiX → one exe that bundles a
trimmed Java runtime (~40 MB). The target PC needs no Java.

**Q: Why does the app ask for admin at launch?**
A: Blocking needs it (DNS, firewall, closing processes). Before elevating, the
app captures the real user's Desktop so the exam folder lands on the student's
desktop, not the admin's.

**Q: What if the sealed log is edited?**
A: The dashboard re-computes SHA-256; it will not match the stored signature
and the file is reported as tampered.

**Q: If the invigilator forgets the password?**
A: No backdoor, by design. An admin deleting the credential file starts
first-run again with a NEW password; old sealed logs stay locked forever. That
trade-off is documented.

**Handover:** "Together, this is Cheat.Guard: it closes the doors, watches the
room, and seals the evidence."

# EVERYONE — the shared last page

## Known limits (say them proudly — honesty scores)

1. A cheat site sharing the exact same CDN address as an approved site cannot
   be told apart without reading encrypted traffic (needs much more than a
   course project). No practical way for a normal student to use it.
2. A phone beside the keyboard or photographing the screen is physics, not
   software. (Streaming/uploading IS blocked by the firewall layer.)
3. Someone with the PC's own administrator password is above any program on it.
   We detect tampering and force a visible reset; a university portal with
   server-side accounts would close this fully.
4. Pre-exam content was the open door through allowed apps, so it is now
   closed from five sides: allowed apps start FRESH (closed at session start,
   relaunched on the exam folder in the student's own session), the recent-file
   lists are wiped, editor tab titles must carry the exam folder's name,
   permitted interpreters are checked by command line, and - the strongest
   layer - the student's account is denied read access to everything outside
   the exam folder by NTFS permissions. What remains: a note typed into an
   editor with no file name at all during the exam - no monitor can read a
   program's mind, but there is also no pre-exam file left to open.

## Numbers to memorize

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Java classes / lines | 35 classes, ~6,000 lines |
| PowerShell helper | ~730 lines |
| Tests | 76 checks, 15 groups |
| Password hashing | PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 210,000 rounds, 16-byte salt |
| Log sealing | AES-256-CBC + SHA-256 signature |
| Password rule | 8+ chars, letters + number/symbol |
| Wrong tries | 5 → lockout 30 s doubling, max 15 min |
| DNS filter | 127.0.0.1:53 + ::1:53, cache 30 s |
| Watchdog cycle | every 1.2 s; startup grace 60 s |
| File walls | student account denied read access outside the exam folder |
| Installer | one exe, ~40 MB, own Java runtime |

## The one-map revision (who calls whom)

```
main() → ensureElevated() → start() → first-run / home screen
"Start exam session" → setup screen → startExam()
startExam() → ExamSession (log file) → SecurityVault.beginProtection
            → StrictNetworkLockdown.start() (DNS server + elevated helper)
            → WatchdogEngine (1.2 s loop)
Every event → Violation → LogManager (file) + listener (screen)
End (password) → finishActiveExam() → sealVault() → stopAndRestore()
Dashboard (password) → SecurityVault.openLog / deleteLog
```

## If Sir asks something you cannot answer

1. Bridge: "In our design, the closest thing we built is …" and explain that.
2. Honest limit: "That needs a server or driver layer beyond this project — we
   listed it as a known limit."
3. Never invent an API or a number. "I would check the code to be exact" is a
   fine answer.
4. If Sir corrects you: "Thank you Sir — we will note it as an improvement."
